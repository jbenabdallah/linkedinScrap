In parallel, most crypto tokenomics have failed to deliver long-term fairness, favoring insiders over users.\n\nWe're here to change that.\n\nUsual is the first stablecoin protocol that gives back ownership and value to its users. By turning users into stakeholders, we're building a more equitable financial infrastructure — one where value flows back to the community.\n\nIn just a few months, we built and launched a full protocol from scratch, introduced a new kind of stablecoin backed by tokenized US Treasuries (USD0), its yield-bearing counterpart (USD0++), and a revenue-sharing governance token ($USUAL). The protocol reached $1.8B in TVL at its peak and continues to evolve with major product and governance upgrades.\n\nWe're a small, focused team of DeFi natives with a strong execution track record and a clear ambition to reshape how value circulates in crypto.\n\n Your Role\n\nWe're looking for a Product Designer to take full ownership of design and user experience for a new product stack being developed inside Usual Lab.\n\nThis is a foundational role: you'll be the design lead within a small, autonomous squad — bridging design and development to ensure the products you design are implemented seamlessly and deliver the intended user experience.\n\nYour mission will be to translate complex mechanisms into intuitive user journeys, build the design system from scratch, and work hand-in-hand with engineers to bring your work into production.\n\nYou'll own the entire product design scope — and also play an active role in grooming, ticketing, syncing with devs, and following up on design implementation to ensure quality and alignment.\n\nThis role is perfect for someone who thrives in early-stage, fast-paced environments and wants to build real DeFi products from 0 1.\n\n‍ You'll Work Within a Dedicated Squad\nStack/Project Lead\nProduct Designer (you)\nTech Lead (Solidity)\n1 Solidity Engineer\n1 Backend Engineer\n1 Frontend Engineer\n1 Quant\n\n You will\nDesign elegant, user-centered experiences for a new DeFi product, from onboarding to edge cases.\nOwn and build a clean, scalable design system that sets the tone for this stack.\nCraft flows, interfaces, and prototypes that make complex interactions feel intuitive.\nWork closely with developers during grooming and implementation to ensure designs are understood, built to spec, and optimized in production.\nLead user journey mapping, interface structure, and micro-interactions.\nBuild high-fidelity prototypes and iterate quickly based on feedback.\nMaintain close collaboration with the product lead and engineers to ensure smooth delivery from design to deployment.\nContribute to brand and interface design for related web pages or dashboards.\n\n You Have\n4+ years in product or UX/UI design, ideally with experience in fintech or DeFi.\nExperience designing for Web3 platforms (wallets, tokens, flows, DeFi user behaviors).\nStrong design craft: attention to layout, micro-interactions, responsiveness, accessibility.\nFluency with Figma — including auto-layout, components, and prototyping.\nAbility to explain design decisions clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\nBonus: Experience with Framer or similar tools for building lightweight marketing pages.\nBonus: Experience collaborating directly with engineers on delivery and QA.\n\n You Are\nAutonomous and proactive — you take ownership and push things forward.\nCurious and comfortable working with technical teams.\nA strong communicator who builds trust across design and engineering.\nNot afraid to start from a blank page and make decisions in ambiguous contexts.\nPassionate about DeFi, crypto, and building for real users.\n\n What Success Looks Like\nA thoughtful, consistent user experience that makes complex DeFi mechanisms feel effortless.\nA design system that's scalable and easy for devs to implement.\nSmooth, collaborative workflows between design and engineering — ensuring what's in production matches what's been designed.\nClear product flows, fast iteration, and tight handoff between design and engineering.\nYou're the go-to person for product design decisions — and a key contributor to delivery quality.\n\n Why Join Us?\nWork in a small, elite team at the frontier of DeFi.\nTake full ownership of a product experience from day one.\nShape a new product stack with autonomy and velocity.\nShip real products with impact — no red tape, no middle layers.\nCompetitive salary and token options.\nRemote-first, async-friendly culture."}

You will be playing a pivotal role in making Paradox play at that level and becoming an iconic brand.\n\nFor us, being Iconic is to innovate at the intersection of Psychology x Creativity x Technology.\n\nYou’ll be at the heart of Paradox’s growth engine, working hand-in-hand with the CEO to build and scale the systems, team, and operations that power our global ambitions.\n\nTo do so, here are your 5 main responsibilities :\n\n1 | Lead Strategic Projects & CEO Initiatives\n\nFrom growth hacks to operational buildouts, you’ll own entire strategic projects.\n\nThink:\n\nBuilding a cold outreach engine or international brand partnerships\n\nSetting up sponsorships for our YouTube & events\n\nTesting acquisition channels & AI-powered growth playbooks\n\nSourcing elite talent & streamlining HR processes\n\nHelping secure and negotiate deals\n\n2 | Pirate Squad Rapid Experiments & Global Launches\n\nWe move fast, but we want to move even faster.

This is not for everyone. We’re looking for someone elite—both in mindset and execution. If this sounds like you, read on:\n\nYou likely come from a top-tier business or engineering school (HEC, ESSEC, X, Sciences Po, Stanford… you get the idea).\n\nYou’ve already built or scaled something—startup, ops team, or growth engine.\n\nYou’re driven with a strong work ethic – you show up with commitment, perseverance, and thrive under pressure.\n\nYou have a true entrepreneurial spirit – you can own projects from scratch, work with limited resources, and get your hands dirty to make things happen.\n\nYou execute relentlessly – a pragmatic problem-solver who thrives on ownership, not hand-holding.\n\nYou’re obsessed with growth – both personal and team-wide – and love learning, building, and optimizing.\n\nYou embrace growth over ego – open to feedback, eager to improve, and driven by progress, not praise.\n\nYou’re analytical, autonomous, and fast, with a natural ability to structure systems and automate for scale.\n\nYou’re tech-savvy and either already AI-native or actively becoming one—AI is your playground.\n\nYou’re naturally persuasive – you love influence, sales, negotiation, and can align others without force.\n\nYou excel in communication, both written and verbal, and tailor your message to your audience.\n\nYou’ll be working directly with a CEO who has extreme work ethic, expects excellence, and gives massive ownership. If that energizes rather than intimidates you, you’re in the right place.\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish: fluent. You can hold a conversation on specific details with English-speaking colleagues. Our chosen language for written communication is English.\n\nFrench: ideally bilingual.\n\nCurrently, 20% of the team is International, from the cherry blossoms of Japan, the Canadian lakes and to the forest of Madagascar.\n\nIT MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU\n-\n\nLet’s be clear, we are looking for someone who is not just Great, and for whom Paradox ambition isn’t just another cool project; but a true mission.\n\nSo if those personal interests : personal development / coaching / professional growth / education / edtech / teaching / edutainment are not things you REALLY love, let’s forget it!\n\nLet’s forget about it also if,\n\nYou don’t like to be challenged and grow in your job\n\nYou don't like receiving or giving tough feedbacks\n\nYou don’t question the status quo: the process are there for a reason, we have always done it this way\n\nYou like to have very specific & fixed tasks assigned to you.

Some want to start their own venture, some want to become an intrapreneur in their current organization, some others just want their day-to-day tasks to have more meaning.\n\nPARADOX HAS ONE GOAL: TO EMPOWER PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS TO LIVE THEIR TRUE AMBITIONS.\n\nBut where do we start?\n\nIf you have an interest in personal development, you probably already know that:\n\nMaking things happen is a real struggle when you don’t know what truly inspires you and how to get there ;\n\nAvailable resources are either boring or full of crazy unsubstantiated theories .\n\nIt needs to change, and we’re here to make it happen!\n\n️ OUR AMBITION IS TO MAKE SUCCESS THE ONLY POSSIBLE OUTCOME FOR OUR CLIENTS (WHATEVER SUCCESS MEANS FOR THEM), BY CRAFTING INNOVATIVE & CAPTIVATING BREAKTHROUGH EXPERIENCES.\n\nIn other words, we want to make personal growth as entertaining as watching Netflix.\n\nHow, you might be wondering?\n\nWe travel the world and surround ourselves with top entrepreneurs (Richard Branson - Founder of Virgin, Marc Simoncini - Founder of Meeting, Fred Mazzella - Founder of BlablaCar), world athletes (Tony Parker - Hall of fame NBA Player, Frederick Bousquet - World record in 50m free swimming, Frank Leboeuf - WorldCup Footballer), and artists (Gad Elmaleh - Comedian, Franck Dubosc, Barry Osborne - Producer of Lord of the Rings and Matrix) ;\n\nWe reverse engineer their strategies for achieving success and fulfillment and lean on the latest researches about neurosciences ;\n\nWe deliver trainings & educational contents around Power Skills (critical thinking, productivity, leadership, public speaking, coaching, stress management, etc.), self-growth and performance, through a balanced set of e-learning programs, events and edutainment videos .\n\nFrom one well-known Founder to a team of +40 people today (and counting!), this approach has paid off and enabled us to exceed 2 million followers on social networks, and to have thousands of people attending our online events and training courses.\n\nTOGETHER, WE ARE DRIVEN BY ONE DREAM:\n\nHelping 100 000 people achieve their dream and display their pictures on what we call the “100 000 dreams wall” ;\n\nGiving our clients access to constant personal growth by reinventing their learning experience ;\n\nLeverage AI and other technology to provide an outstanding customized experience to millions of people for them to transform their lives.\n\nAnd that’s where you come in.

This is not for everyone. We’re looking for someone elite—both in mindset and execution. If this sounds like you, read on:\n\nYou likely come from a top-tier business or engineering school (HEC, ESSEC, X, Sciences Po, Stanford… you get the idea).\n\nYou’ve already built or scaled something—startup, ops team, or growth engine.\n\nYou’re driven with a strong work ethic – you show up with commitment, perseverance, and thrive under pressure.\n\nYou have a true entrepreneurial spirit – you can own projects from scratch, work with limited resources, and get your hands dirty to make things happen.\n\nYou execute relentlessly – a pragmatic problem-solver who thrives on ownership, not hand-holding.\n\nYou’re obsessed with growth – both personal and team-wide – and love learning, building, and optimizing.\n\nYou embrace growth over ego – open to feedback, eager to improve, and driven by progress, not praise.\n\nYou’re analytical, autonomous, and fast, with a natural ability to structure systems and automate for scale.\n\nYou’re tech-savvy and either already AI-native or actively becoming one—AI is your playground.\n\nYou’re naturally persuasive – you love influence, sales, negotiation, and can align others without force.\n\nYou excel in communication, both written and verbal, and tailor your message to your audience.\n\nYou’ll be working directly with a CEO who has extreme work ethic, expects excellence, and gives massive ownership. If that energizes rather than intimidates you, you’re in the right place.\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish: fluent. You can hold a conversation on specific details with English-speaking colleagues. Our chosen language for written communication is English.\n\nFrench: ideally bilingual.\n\nCurrently, 20% of the team is International, from the cherry blossoms of Japan, the Canadian lakes and to the forest of Madagascar.\n\nIT MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU\n-\n\nLet’s be clear, we are looking for someone who is not just Great, and for whom Paradox ambition isn’t just another cool project; but a true mission.\n\nSo if those personal interests : personal development / coaching / professional growth / education / edtech / teaching / edutainment are not things you REALLY love, let’s forget it!\n\nLet’s forget about it also if,\n\nYou don’t like to be challenged and grow in your job\n\nYou don't like receiving or giving tough feedbacks\n\nYou don’t question the status quo: the process are there for a reason, we have always done it this way\n\nYou like to have very specific & fixed tasks assigned to you.
