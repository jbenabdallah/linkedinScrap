Organizations still depend on oversized teams and aging tools to manually produce content, facilitate moderation, and pull actionable insights from fragmented user interactions. Even with AI technology widely available, deploying a simple automation typically requires weeks of effort, often resulting in pilots that never reach production. The consequences include lost revenue opportunities, exhausted personnel, and technology infrastructures unable to match the pace of contemporary commerce.IgniteTech is dismantling this paradigm. We replace human-intensive processes with adaptive, AI-driven systems capable of operating at 10x the traditional scale and velocity. Picture a marketing apparatus that generates and publishes material in response to live trend data, or a community infrastructure that aggregates, moderates, and distributes insights within seconds—all built, launched, and refined by a compact team of AI-fluent engineers working in 24-hour cycles. We don't stop at prototypes; we deliver functioning tools that immediately reshape operational workflows.This position is not suited for someone interested in managing Jira backlogs within conventional DevOps cycles. You will not receive a requirements document to implement. You will instead assume full ownership of intelligent systems designed to automate and advance our client operations. Your work will involve diagnosing friction points, designing AI-centric architectures, delivering MVPs in less than a day, and hardening them into robust production engines with measurable outcomes.
