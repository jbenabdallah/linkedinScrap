Aujourd’hui ce sont plus de 700 000 dirigeants de startups, TPE/PME/ETI ainsi que plus de 6500 cabinets d'expertise-comptable que Pennylane accompagne tous les jours en les aidant à mieux piloter leur activité.\n\nPourquoi ce rôle est-il si important chez nous ?\n\nAujourd'hui, c'est plus de 6 500 cabinets d'expertise comptable qui ont décidé de migrer (au moins) une partie de leur portefeuille clients sur Pennylane (et plus de 50 nouveaux cabinets tous les mois). Changer de logiciel de comptabilité pour un cabinet n'est pas une mince affaire : les cabinets nous confient leur cœur de métier. Cela implique que nous puissions migrer des données financières et comptables hautement sensibles, paramétrer Pennylane de sorte à ce que l'outil puisse répondre aux besoins d’interopérabilité spécifiques d'un cabinet.\n\nDans un contexte de migrations croissantes Nous ouvrons de nouvelles positions pour une équipe existante d'une trentaine de personnes au global.\n\nComment vas-tu contribuer au projet ?\n\nEn tant que Partner Solution Architect (ou appelé Technical Project Manager), tu es le(la) responsable de l'implémentation technique de la solution Pennylane au sein des cabinets d'expertise comptable qui ont décidé de migrer sur notre outil.\n\nTon rôle est donc de travailler avec une multitude de parties prenantes (au sein du cabinet et de Pennylane) afin d'assurer la migration la plus efficace et rapide possible.\n\nOn t’attendra notamment sur ta capacité à être autonome/opérationnel rapidement ainsi que communiquer de manière fluide, que ce soit avec notre équipe tech en interne qu’avec des interlocuteurs externes tels que des DSI, DAF, comptables…\n\nQuelles seront tes missions au quotidien ?\n\n3 premiers mois :\n\n- Tu intègres ton équipe et passes du temps avec chaque membre pour te familiariser avec ce nouvel environnement\n- Tu apprends tout ce qu'il faut savoir sur notre entreprise, notre vision, et nos différents départements- - Tu te formes sur le produit et la gestion comptable grâce à des modules de formation e-learning\n- Tu passes du temps avec l'équipe PSA en place (dont certains(es) ont déjà le même rôle chez nous) et qui sera en charge de ta formation métier\n- Tu commences à assister sur des premières migrations, en lien avec l'équipe PSA en place\n\n4 à 6 mois :\n\n- Tu deviens autonome et gère ton propre backlog\n- Tu audites, analyses et définis les besoins techniques et fonctionnels de chaque nouveau client\n- Tu rédiges les documents d'audit initiaux et les spécifications fonctionnelles et techniques détaillées relatives aux développements spécifiques\n- Tu accompagnes les cabinets à connecter Pennylane à leurs outils internes : CRMs, ERPs, gestion interne, facturation, …\n- Tu paramètres la solution Pennylane, en travaillant à la reprise de l’existant des systèmes d’information des cabinets comptables et des clients (Outils de production comptable, logiciels de facturation, etc.)\n- Tu effectues les recettes intermédiaires et finales, avec production de rapport d’analyses post-migration, d’études et d’analyses des écarts\n- Tu collabores étroitement avec l’ensemble des interlocuteurs techniques et métiers impliqués dans les projets : DSI de cabinet, éditeurs de logiciels, sociétés externes de service, etc.,\n- Tu commences à travailler sur l'automatisation de l’ensemble de ces tâches, afin d'optimiser le temps d'intégration des cabinets dans le futur avec ton regard neuf\n- Tu participes à la priorisation de la roadmap de Pennylane avec les équipes Tech et Produit de Pennylane, grâce à ta compréhension avancée des besoins des cabinets\n\nEt ensuite... :\n\n- Tu cherches et mets en place des solutions pour optimiser et automatiser les processus de migration déjà en place\n- Tu deviens un membre actif, participant à la vie de l’équipe en proposant des workshops ou des prises de parole en interne\n- Tu développes des process et des outils afin d'accroître la productivité de ton travail et de celui des différentes parties prenantes impliquées dans les migrations\n- Tu participes à la migration de clients de plus en plus importants, avec un cahier des charges qui monte en complexité\n- Comme Pennylane grandit très vite, tu auras de multiples opportunités d'évoluer au sein de l'entreprise ; vers du management d'équipe, du leadership technique, de la gestion de projet complexe, ou tout autre rôle qui pourrait t'intéresser\n\n Ce qu'on peut t'offrir :\n\n Une mutuelle parmi les meilleures sur le marché (Alan Blue et Alan Mind)\n Des tickets restaurants (Carte Swile)\n Entre 6 et 13 jours de RTT supplémentaires aux 5 semaines de congés payés\n La possibilité de perfectionner ton anglais grâce à Busuu\n‍ Un budget dédié chaque mois pour tous nos Pennylaners, favorisant le travail depuis la maison ou en espace de coworking\n Une facilité d’accès à nos bureaux, situés à quelques minutes de Saint Lazare en plein cœur de Paris\n Une enveloppe de BSPCE\n‍ ️ Un accès à 8000 salles de sport partout en France et plus de 300 activités de bien-être via notre partenaire Gymlib\n Un Mac\n Nous pratiquons de nombreux sports ensemble et avons à cœur de nous réunir régulièrement autour d’événements d’entreprise tels que les Tech Days (qui permettent aux Pennylaners en remote de se réunir tous les 3 mois) ou notre séminaire d’entreprise qui a lieu une fois par an, et qui favorise de grands moments de cohésion pour toutes et tous.\n\n Process de recrutement\n\n Une première rencontre avec Thomas, (Talent Acquisition Manager) : 30 min\n Un second entretien avec Baptiste ou Kayreddine (Team Leads Associates) : 45 min - 1H\n Cas pratique avec 2 personnes de l'équipe TPM : 1H\n Dernier entretien avec Tristan (Partner Success Director) et/ou Cornelia (Head of Partner Solutions) : 45 min - 1H\n Team Fit avec d'autres personnes de l'équipe\n\n Tu es le bon candidat si :\n\n Une expérience confirmée en gestion de projet et de toutes les parties prenantes internes et externes\n Une bonne maîtrise du SQL\n De bonnes connaissances en scripting (Python principalement)\n Appétence pour l’automatisation\n Faculté à vulgariser et à parler de sujets techniques en adaptant le discours aux interlocuteurs\n Tu es capable de travailler dans un contexte international (anglais écrit et parlé)\n Capable de travailler de façon transverse avec plusieurs squad et/ ou corps de métier\n Tu es autonome et proactif\n\n#LI-Remote\nLe mot de la fin ?\n\nNous sommes ouverts sur les pré-requis pour ce rôle. De nombreuses recherches montrent que certaines personnes ont tendance à se dévaloriser plus que d’autres, et à ne pas postuler lorsqu’elles ne cochent pas toutes les cases d’une fiche de poste.\n\nA travers cette description, nous essayons de te donner assez d’éléments sur la mission, le quotidien et l’environnement de ce poste pour te permettre de nous dire toi-même si tu penses a) t’épanouir chez nous et b) apporter de la valeur à notre projet.\nSi tu hésites, nous t’encourageons à candidater quand même : dans le pire des cas, tu auras perdu quelques minutes, et dans le meilleur, ce sera peut-être le début d’une longue et belle collaboration.\n\nNous tenons aussi à rappeler que nous mettons un point d’honneur à fournir les mêmes opportunités à chaque candidat•e, indépendamment de son origine, son sexe, ses aptitudes ou les traits qui le•la définissent. Nous célébrons nos différences et sommes convaincus qu’elles font de Pennylane une entreprise plus prospère et dans laquelle il fait bon évoluer.\n\nPour finir avec un modeste exemple de notre engagement, nous avons récemment signé le Pacte Parité dans le but de fixer des objectifs concrets vers un environnement de travail plus inclusif et équitable.\nWe may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.

This position places you in charge of an AI product from start to finish: weekly customer meetings, product decisions, and production deployments. You have two core objectives: enable Kayako One to resolve support tickets autonomously and create an AI-driven sales pipeline that handles prospects from initial contact through deal closure. The stack, roadmap, release schedule, and results all fall under your control.The broader industry separates engineers from end users under the guise of \"process.\" That's not our approach. No chain of product managers, designers, or \"customer success\" teams stands between you and ground truth. You'll lead weekly discovery sessions, convert user pain into product specifications, deliver rapidly, and track tangible outcomes. You'll also develop the AI sales automation infrastructure that may serve as the blueprint for Trilogy's portfolio-wide selling approach. Here, adoption metrics, resolution rates, CSAT scores, and pipeline velocity define success.This role means owning the entire system: new AI capabilities in Kayako One that improve ticket resolution; CRM and ticketing platform integrations; outreach workflows and targeting algorithms; pipeline connectors; reporting that validates effectiveness; plus deployments, monitoring, and incident management to maintain uptime. This is not a backend-only position executing tickets someone else defined, nor a comfortable lane with handoffs. You'll code when necessary, configure AWS expertly, adopt tools like Voiceflow or Cursor seamlessly, and ensure LLMs perform reliably in production rather than merely impressing in demos.You'll operate at the leading edge of our help desk product and an AI sales automation initiative, with portfolio-wide exposure. Success means customers actively using your releases, faster ticket resolutions, improved end-user satisfaction, and a more efficient, faster-moving pipeline. If you want to own results, engage customers weekly, reject distractions, and ship solutions that drive key metrics, this is your opening.What You Will Be DoingDesign and deploy Kayako One features—AI-driven ticket resolution improvements, CRM/ticketing integrations, robust and scalable infrastructure, plus performance optimizations and bug remediation.Conduct weekly customer discovery sessions to convert genuine pain points into product requirements and confirm product strategy with users.Develop the AI sales automation infrastructure—outreach workflows, pipeline and tool integrations, automated progression through sales stages, and performance dashboards.Manage deployments and operations—end-to-end releases, monitoring/alerting/incident handling, and AWS/database infrastructure administration.What You Won’t Be DoingIt isn't simply coding to specifications someone else created — you define what gets built based on customer feedback.It isn't work confined to staging environments — every solution you create reaches production and actual customers.It isn't narrow technical focus — you control the complete stack, infrastructure, and customer journey.Senior AI Engineer Key ResponsibilitiesDevelop and maintain an AI-driven customer support system that resolves tickets without human interventionDevelop and maintain a complete AI sales pipeline that moves deals from initial contact through closureBasic RequirementsMinimum 5 years of professional software development experienceTrack record of owning complete products or major systems, beyond individual featuresProven experience delivering AI/LLM-powered products to production (beyond prototypes or demonstrations)Extensive AWS expertise, including Lambda, S3, OpenSearch, RDS, CloudWatch, EventBridge, EC2, Route 53, CloudFrontLLM/AI integration expertise, including prompt engineering for Claude/ChatGPT and API integrationProficiency coding in Python, Java, and JavaScriptWorking experience with MySQL databaseHands-on experience with Docker, deployment pipelines, and GitHub workflowsPractical experience with OpenAI and JWT API developmentBackground in DNS management and web infrastructureDirect customer-facing experienceAbout TrilogyHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform.
