Organizations continue to depend on oversized teams and antiquated platforms to manually produce content, manage discussions, and synthesize insights from fragmented data sources. Even with AI advancements widely accessible, the typical deployment timeline for basic automation stretches into weeks, frequently culminating in a \"pilot\" that never reaches production. The consequences include lost opportunities, exhausted personnel, and infrastructure unable to match the pace of contemporary business demands.IgniteTech is dismantling this paradigm. We replace labor-intensive processes with AI-native, self-optimizing systems that operate at 10x the scale and velocity. Consider a marketing infrastructure that generates and distributes content driven by real-time market signals, or a community ecosystem that synthesizes, curates, and channels insights within seconds—all developed, launched, and refined by a compact team of AI-proficient engineers working in 24-hour cycles. Our focus is not on prototyping; we deliver production-grade tools that immediately redefine operational workflows.This position is not suited for someone seeking to manage Jira backlogs within conventional DevOps frameworks. You will not receive detailed specifications to implement. Rather, you will control the complete lifecycle of intelligent automation systems that transform client operations. Your mandate includes diagnosing operational friction, designing AI-centric architectures, delivering MVPs within a single day, and evolving them into robust production engines with measurable impact. If your goal is a testing ground for GenAI experimentation, look elsewhere. But if you intend to leverage GenAI as a strategic tool for decisive execution, this is your opportunity.You will join a select team reimagining entire business functions with AI as the foundation. You will engage directly with leadership, operate at high velocity, and evaluate success by tangible business outcomes.

Audit stage integrity (no skipping stages) and flag/correct exceptions. Detect and escalate stagnant deals (>3 days of inactivity) and chase next steps. Support Company QA system by preparing weekly \"hygiene issue repot\" (missing logs, missing next steps, stagnation) to speed up coaching.\n\n3) Weekly Reporting & Data Pulls : Prepare the weekly reporting pack outputs (data pulls + formatting) so the Lead SDR can finalize and send, a separate set of reports for management for internal reviews. Maintain reporting accuracy by ensuring CRM activity logs and deal stages are current (reporting depends on CRM integrity).\n\n4) Process Support (Task Follow-ups, Deal Stage Integrity, Reminders) : Own the admin follow-through loop: identify missed tasks, missing logs, and broken next steps; notify the SDR; confirm resolution. Ensure lists do not create duplicates on subsequent waves (dedupe before import, not after). Document your process, queries, and best practices so we can reuse winning patterns across clients.\n\nTools Required\n\nHubSpot (Deals/Pipelines, Tasks, Imports/Exports, activity logging checks)\nLinkedIn Sales Navigator (list building)\nProspeo (exports per process)\nClay (Data enrichment)\nLusha (Data Enrichment)\nData scrapers\nChatGPT/Gemini\nGoogle Sheets / Excel (CSV prep, formulas like XLOOKUP/VLOOKUP, dedupe)\n\nRequired Skills\n\nBachelor's Degree in Information Systems, Data/Computer Science, 13 years' experience in B2B research, data enrichment, or sales operations, supporting SDR/outbound teams.\nStrong hands-on experience with HubSpot CRM objects (contacts, companies, deals, reporting, custom properties).\nStrong spreadsheet skills: cleaning, deduping, CSVs, formulas (XLOOKUP/VLOOKUP), macros, building custom reports, attention to data detail.\nHubSpot: imports/exports, pipelines, tasks, and checking activity hygiene.\nStrong online research ability (LinkedIn Sales navigator + company sources Clay, Lusha etc.).\nData scraping skills using tools (serper.dev, etc.)\nClear written and spoken English; ability to produce clean weekly reporting drafts.\nFamiliarity with additional databases/enrichment tools (optional).\n\nWorking Hours / Mon-Friday 9AM-5PM Dubai Time (40 hours per week)\n\nOverlap Expectation ASSUMPTION: At least 4 hours overlap with UAE business hours (GMT+4) for daily handoffs and same-day fixes.\n\nWhat Good Looks Like (15/ 30 / 45+ Days)\n\nFirst 15 Days Run the end-to-end \"list -> ready deals\" workflow with minimal supervision. Weekly reporting packs are reliably prepared on time; Lead SDR only finalizes and sends. You can explain clearly why a specific list is built the way it is (hypothesis, filters, personas).\n\nFirst 30 Days Hygiene is visibly improving: fewer stagnant deals, fewer missing logs, fewer \"where did this go?\" questions. Consistently catch missing next steps / missing logs early and drive corrections.\n\nFirst 45 Days Ops becomes predictable: imports, hygiene, and reporting run consistently without surprises. SDRs say: These leads are onpoint for my market and ICP!, spend more time on research/personalization/outreach because the operating system removes friction.\n\nFirst 60 Days The process you follow is clearly documented in the respective company's Notion section across all aspects and is being revised every month."}

We've proven the model works with thousands of learners. Now we need to scale it to millions across the Global South.\n\nThe skills gap in the Global South is massive. There are three billion people under the age of 25 who need to be trained for the AI-driven tech workforce, and schools don’t know how to keep up. We've solved the product challenge by harnessing the engagement of game-making, the multidisciplinary nature of games, and the power of community with peer learning to deliver an education that gets better with scale. Now we need someone who can solve the distribution challenge.
