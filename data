We’re a remote-first, fast-growing SaaS company helping brands turn static content into digital discovery experiences that drive results.\n\nWe’re not about busywork, hierarchy, or hand-holding. We hire sharp minds, trust them fully, and measure success by real results, not noise. If you thrive in autonomy, challenge, and high ownership, you’ll love it here.\n\nAs we continue to grow in the The Americas markets , we’re seeking a Sales Director to own and drive revenue across this region.\n\nThis role is for you if you…\n\nYou have 8+ years of experience in B2B sales, with a strong track record in SaaS and consultative selling.\n\nYou are very senior in the US retail and e-commerce landscape — you understand market dynamics, key players, buying cycles, and what drives value for retailers and brands in the USA.\n\nYou speak and write fluent English\n\nYou have proven experience leading complex enterprise and mid-market deals end-to-end, from pipeline build to close.\n\nYou’ve consistently hit and exceeded revenue targets in competitive markets.\n\nYou are a strategic thinker who can translate customer pain into business outcomes and long-term partnerships.\n\nYou’re comfortable working fully remote and async, using tools like HubSpot, Slack, Zoom, and modern sales enablement stacks.\n\nYou’re a self-starter who thrives on ownership, pace, and building something bigger than yourself.\n\nThis role is NOT for you if you…\n\nNeed layers of process or someone to constantly tell you what to do\n\nPrefer “business as usual” over change\n\nWant a team where mediocre is okay\n\nHave never worked remotely and think async means “lonely”\n\nAre waiting for permission instead of taking initiative\n\nDon’t enjoy hands-on selling alongside strategic leadership\n\nThe work you’ll do…\n\nAs a Sales Director at Publitas, you will own revenue growth in the USA, focusing on new business and market expansion. In more detail:\n\nOwn the US market: build and execute a high-impact go-to-market strategy for retail and e-commerce customers across America.\n\nDrive new ARR: manage the full sales cycle — prospecting, discovery, demos, negotiation, and close — with a strong focus on value-based selling.\n\nBuild a healthy pipeline: consistently generate and develop qualified opportunities in close collaboration with Marketing.\n\nLead complex deals: navigate multi-stakeholder buying committees and win high-value enterprise and mid-market customers.\n\nBe the retail/e-commerce expert in USA: bring sharp market insights, competitive intelligence, and customer feedback to shape our positioning and approach.\n\nPartner with Customer Success: ensure clean handovers, align on expansion opportunities, and keep the customer journey tight.\n\nCollaborate cross-functionally with Product and Marketing to improve product-market fit and unlock growth opportunities.\n\nForecast accurately and communicate clearly on performance, risks, and opportunities.\n\nRepresent Publitas externally: at key French retail events, customer meetings, and industry moments where it matters.\n\nWho you are…\n\nRevenue owner: You take full responsibility for outcomes, not just activities.\n\nRetail/e-commerce insider: You know the US market deeply and can speak the customer’s language — commercially and culturally.\n\nStrategic closer: You don’t just sell features; you sell impact and long-term value.\n\nPipeline builder: You create momentum — you don’t wait for it.\n\nHigh-trust communicator: Clear, persuasive, and strong with senior stakeholders.\n\nRemote-first operator: You work effectively async, manage your time well, and don’t need close supervision.\n\nBuilder mindset: You enjoy shaping approach, testing ideas, and growing a region like it’s your own business.\n\nWhat We Provide to Help You Win…\n\nNegotiable base salary depending on your experience and location. In addition to the base, we offer an uncapped variable compensation plan (VCP)—your earning potential is directly tied to your performance.\n\n25 vacation days + your local national holidays\n\nA top-tier MacBook and remote-ready gear\n\nMonthly wellness budget to invest in your health\n\nCo-Working allowance\n\nEvents, training, or courses that directly and primarily contribute to your work at Publitas\n\nFree books on Kindle and Audible\n\nFree Publitas Swag (merchandise)\n\nHow to Apply…\n\nWe don’t ask for CVs or cover letters. Why? Because they rarely tell us who you are or what you’re truly great at.\n\nInstead, we ask smart questions and give you a chance to show us what you’d bring to the role.\n\nNo fluff. Just real insight into what it’s like to work together."}
