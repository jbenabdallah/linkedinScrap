Our web-browser platform provides teams with all the workflows around video engagement to promote, host and analyze online events.\n\nLivestorm is built with ease of use in mind. We serve companies of all sizes, from startups to Fortune 500s. Brands like Shopify, Honda, Spendesk, Front and Revolut trust Livestorm for premium video engagement during their online events.\n\nHere are our core values:\n\nStay curious: Be interested in the world around you.\n\nRemain humble: Keep learning and keep your ego in check.\n\nBe resourceful: Go that extra mile in the most efficient way.\n\nOwn it: Take pride in what you do, own your wins, and fails.\n\nBe transparent: Sharing knowledge, learnings, feedback, and mistakes.\n\nMissions:\n\nTo support Livestorm’s mission and steady growth, we are looking for a Lead Solutions Engineer to steer the function and elevate how we deliver and scale technical services for our customers—especially around CRM integrations, API-based workflows, and custom implementations.\n\nThis role is about being at the forefront of client-facing technical excellence—guiding customers through complex setups and building value-driven solutions that extend far beyond our existing features. You’ll oversee and contribute to three major types of solution work:\n\nAdvanced CRM integration workflows – where the Solutions Engineering team helps customers configure powerful, flexible automations using our integrations and adjacent tools.\n\nCustom solutions built with our API, webhooks, and low-code/no-code stacks – enabling customers to do more by combining Livestorm with platforms like Make, Zapier, n8n, Retool, Airtable, and a new wave of AI-powered app builders like Bubble, Loveable, or Superblocks.\n\nDevelopment of our integration partner and agency ecosystem – establishing strategic relationships with implementation agencies and technical partners to deliver solutions at scale.\n\nAs the Team Lead, you’ll manage one senior solutions engineer, serve as a hands-on contributor, and develop our ecosystem of third-party agencies and partners. You’ll also play a key role in enabling Sales, CSMs, and Support teams by sharing technical knowledge, tooling, and playbooks.\n\nIn this role, you'll be responsible for:\n\nSolution design & delivery [25%]\n\nLead the technical delivery of integration-based and custom solutions, using Livestorm’s API, webhooks, and low-code platforms like Make, n8n, Zapier, Retool, and Airtable.\n\nRapidly prototype or fully build solutions with next-gen AI builders such as Loveable, Bubble, or Superblocks, exploring what’s possible beyond traditional workflows.\n\nCoordinate with engineering on more complex development needs and ensure alignment with our product vision and scalability.\n\nClient-facing consulting and communication [25%]\n\nAct as a trusted technical consultant in both pre-sales and post-sales conversations.\n\nPlay a key evangelist role for our CRM integrations—showing customers what’s possible, demoing advanced use cases, and advising on optimal configurations and extended automations.\n\nHelp Sales teams craft compelling solution proposals that highlight the extensibility of the Livestorm platform.\n\nPartner and agency network development [15%]\n\nIdentify, recruit, and nurture partnerships with agencies and integration specialists that can extend our delivery capabilities.\n\nCo-develop playbooks and processes with these partners to ensure consistent quality, scope alignment, and customer success.\n\nServe as the main point of contact for these partners and build a scalable partner enablement program.\n\nCross-team enablement [15%]\n\nEquip customer-facing teams (AE, AM, CSM, Support) with relevant documentation, training, and resources so they can better understand and pitch technical capabilities.\n\nProactively identify gaps in knowledge or tooling and drive initiatives to fill them.\n\nTeam leadership & enablement [10%]\n\nManage, coach, and grow the Solutions Engineering team (starting with one senior engineer), providing clarity, support, and a roadmap for impact.\n\nBuild shared knowledge and best practices across the team to drive operational excellence and innovation.\n\nProcess improvement and scaling [10%]\n\nContinuously refine how we scope, deliver, and scale custom solutions—building a playbook that makes us faster, smarter, and more reliable over time.\n\nLead internal knowledge sharing and documentation efforts to make solutions repeatable and impactful across multiple clients.\n\nJob requirements/Who You Are…\n\nFor this Team Lead Solutions Engineer role, we are looking for someone with the following background and mindset:\n\nYou have strong technical acumen and hands-on experience with low-code/no-code platforms (such as Make, Retool, n8n, Zapier, Airtable, or similar).\n\nYou're comfortable speaking the language of APIs and integrations, and you can hold your own in technical conversations without necessarily being a full-stack engineer.\n\nYou have strong savviness with AI-powered tools, especially those related to coding and app-building—you're curious, experimental, and excited by the rapid evolution in this space.\n\nYou’ve worked in a client-facing or consulting role—your communication and interpersonal skills are stellar, and you’re attuned to both technical and business needs.\n\nYou’re a doer with a proactive mindset, ready to jump in, take ownership, and demonstrate leadership by driving initiatives forward and inspiring confidence in others.\n\nYou've managed projects involving external vendors or partners and know how to build collaborative, trusting relationships.\n\nYou’ve led or mentored team members before, or you're ready to step into your first team lead role with confidence.\n\nYou're fluent in both French and English, and comfortable working in a fully remote setup aligned with the Paris time zone ±2 hours.\n\nConfidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But we'll let you in on a secret: there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. So however you identify and whatever background you bring with you, please apply if this is a role that would make you excited to come into work every day."}
