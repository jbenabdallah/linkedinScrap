Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.\n\nCustomer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.\n\nWhen an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.\n\nWork at Veeva. Work where it’s best for you."}
