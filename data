De nombreuses recherches montrent que certaines personnes ont tendance à se dévaloriser plus que d’autres, et à ne pas postuler lorsqu’elles ne cochent pas toutes les cases d’une fiche de poste.\n\nA travers cette description, nous essayons de te donner assez d’éléments sur la mission, le quotidien et l’environnement de ce poste pour te permettre de nous dire toi-même si tu penses a) t’épanouir chez nous et b) apporter de la valeur à notre projet.\nSi tu hésites, nous t’encourageons à candidater quand même : dans le pire des cas, tu auras perdu quelques minutes, et dans le meilleur, ce sera peut-être le début d’une longue et belle collaboration.\n\nNous tenons aussi à rappeler que nous mettons un point d’honneur à fournir les mêmes opportunités à chaque candidat•e, indépendamment de son origine, son sexe, ses aptitudes ou les traits qui le•la définissent. Nous célébrons nos différences et sommes convaincus qu’elles font de Pennylane une entreprise plus prospère et dans laquelle il fait bon évoluer.\n\nPour finir avec un modeste exemple de notre engagement, nous avons récemment signé le Pacte Parité dans le but de fixer des objectifs concrets vers un environnement de travail plus inclusif et équitable.\nWe may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses.

Most organizations employ large teams and aging platforms to manually produce content, oversee discussions, and pull insights from fragmented conversations. Even with AI technology widely available, implementing a simple automation typically requires weeks, often resulting in a \"pilot\" that never reaches production. The consequences include wasted opportunities, exhausted personnel, and technology infrastructure unable to match the pace of contemporary business demands.IgniteTech is dismantling that framework. We replace manual workflows with self-optimizing, AI-driven systems that operate at 10x the scale and velocity. Consider a marketing platform that generates and publishes content in response to live trends, or a community system that consolidates, moderates, and channels insights within seconds—all built, launched, and refined by a compact team of AI-fluent engineers working in 24-hour cycles.

This role puts you in charge of an AI product from start to finish: engaging with customers every week, deciding the roadmap, and deploying to production. Your dual focus: enable Kayako One to resolve support tickets autonomously and construct an AI‑driven sales pipeline that moves prospects from initial contact to closed deal. You own the technology stack, the product direction, the release schedule, and the business results.The broader industry isolates engineers from end users behind layers of \"process.\" We reject that model. No intermediary chain of product managers, designers, or customer success teams stands between you and the field. You'll lead weekly discovery sessions, convert customer challenges into product requirements, release iteratively, and track measurable outcomes. You'll also build the AI sales automation framework that may serve as the blueprint for Trilogy's portfolio‑wide go‑to‑market. Here, success is measured by adoption metrics, resolution rates, customer satisfaction scores, and pipeline velocity.This position means owning the entire system: developing new AI capabilities in Kayako One to improve ticket resolution; building integrations with CRM and ticketing systems; designing outreach workflows and targeting algorithms; creating pipeline connectors; producing reports that validate effectiveness; and managing deployments, monitoring, and incident handling to ensure uptime. This is not a backend‑only role executing pre‑defined tickets, nor a comfortable lane with hand‑offs. You'll write production code as required, configure AWS infrastructure expertly, adopt tools such as Voiceflow or Cursor seamlessly, and ensure LLMs perform reliably in production rather than merely impressing in demos.You'll operate at the leading edge of our help desk product and an AI sales automation initiative, with visibility across the portfolio. Success means customers actively use your releases, resolutions accelerate, end users report higher satisfaction, and the pipeline becomes cleaner and faster.
