  "companyDescription": "air up® is so much more than a water bottle. As the world’s first refillable drinking system that flavors water through scent alone: it’s a hydration revolution. \n\nWhat's meant by this? Science shows that the majority of what we perceive as flavor is actually derived from scents. Our one-of-a-kind drinking system transports carefully-crafted flavors from our pods through the mouth all the way to your olfactory receptors - and that's when your brain perceives the scent as flavor. This is called “retronasal olfaction” - just drinking water, but perceiving it as a flavored beverage. Mind-blowing, we know. But it’s just science.* \n\nSince its launch in Europe in July 2019, air up® has grown into a company that operates in over 11 countries, has more than 300 employees, and enjoys a customer base in the millions.\n\nInterested in following the #thinknewdrinknew journey? Check us out on Facebook and Instagram. Let’s make scents of it [together].\n\n*Link to study regarding taste found here: https://flavourjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13411-015-0040-2#:~:text=It%20is%20frequently%20asserted%20that,from%20the%20sense%20of%20smell.

Every time someone chooses refurbished tech, we avoid additional environmental impact on the planet.\n\nOf course, it’s not just about the tech sold by sellers on our marketplace, it’s also about how we run our business — we hold ourselves to high standards when it comes to our own sustainability practices, too. We work across the refurbishment industry to develop new technologies, support environmental initiatives related to electronic waste (e-waste), and work with local governments across the globe to pass legislation that supports sustainability and the Right to Repair in the tech industry. \n\n\nWe know we’re not alone in our vision for a world where tech respects the planet.

Do you thrive when leading impactful projects that transform business operations? If so, consider joining our team as a Technical Consultant.ResponsibilitiesThis is an in-house role. You will not be outsourced to client teams, but will act as a delivery expert from within Bonitasoft. Here’s a glimpse of what your responsibilities will look like:Own the client relationshipYou'll be involved from the first conversations with the client, helping them shape their vision with realistic and impactful solutions built on the Bonita platform.Your role is central to building trust and setting the tone for a strong collaboration. You’ll clarify expectations, guide solution design, and ensure every step is aligned with client goals.When expectations shift or tensions rise, your calm and clarity will make the difference.Translate needs into sustainable solutionsYou’ll work hand-in-hand with clients to translate functional needs into technical architectures by building smart, maintainable, and scalable process automations.With your technical foundation, you’ll be able to challenge or refine their expectations, explain the “why” behind your approach, and find pragmatic paths forward.Deliver tailored solutionsYou’ll provide direct technical expertise, especially to our partners &amp; customers who often need advanced guidance, even in high-pressure moments.You're not just managing, you're building. This means that you’ll be expected to actively contribute to project implementation, not just coordinate it :Write or review critical parts of the solution codeProactively challenge customer requirements to build scalable and clean technical architectureTroubleshoot complex technical issues during delivery and provide clear, actionable resolutions.Enable, train, and empowerYou won’t just execute, you’ll teach them to be autonomous with the Bonita platform, creating satisfaction through ownership.Protect both the customer and the businessYou’ll know when to push back, when to escalate, and when to say no, always respectfully and transparently.You’ll collaborate with internal teams (Sales, Product, Support, R&amp;D) to find balanced solutions that satisfy the client without putting the business at risk.Work cross-functionally for smarter deliveryYou won’t be alone.

We need someone focused on client-facing project delivery, not on building product features.If you're not comfortable communicating directly with clients or partners, including during tense conversations, you may struggle in this position. You’ll need to be confident, diplomatic, and present when it matters most.If your instinct is to avoid conflict, delay decisions, or overcomplicate situations to mask uncertainty, this won’t be a good fit. We value clarity, responsibility, and the ability to navigate challenges openly with both the client and the team.Onboarding planYour journey with Bonitasoft will follow a structured onboarding plan to set you up for success.During Your Trial PeriodComprehensive training: Get hands-on training in Bonita and our internal tools.Collaboration: Work alongside fellow consultants and your manager as you begin contributing to client projects.Process familiarization: Deliver initial projects to get comfortable with our processes and standards.After 6 MonthsTake the lead: Begin managing consulting missions independently, delivering projects with confidence.Expand your expertise: Continue developing your skills in additional technical areas and use cases.After 1 YearManage more complex projects: Handle more sophisticated and high-impact projects.Full project leadership: Lead projects from A to Z, collaborating closely with our internal development teams.Hiring processLet's get to know each otherPeer programming with the managerProject leadership Role PlayFinal InterviewDon’t be shy in applying even though you don’t match 100% of the criterias.Reach me on Linkedin or apply through the link.
