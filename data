Today, with 5% of sites running 70% of clinical trials, only patients with privileged access to these sites have an opportunity to participate in trials. We envision a world where it’s so easy to find and apply for the right trials that the other 95% of sites – often community-based research sites – can play a bigger role and accelerate research. By expanding access, we can make clinical trials more accessible, efficient, and inclusive. \n\nThat’s why we’ve created a platform that connects global pharmaceutical companies with a broader range of research sites, while ensuring reliable high performance. Our exclusive site profiles, trial application & verification processes, and ongoing support helps sites (at no charge) to get selected and meet enrollment targets, while giving sponsors access to previously untapped patient populations. We’re seeing growing trust in community sites, faster timelines for sponsors and sites, increased patient accessibility, and diversified participation for more inclusive trials.\n\nDrug development is a challenging, intellectually complex, and rewarding endeavor. By working together to bring trial access into communities across the globe, we can more efficiently develop treatments that are safe and effective for everyone.",

  "companyDescription": "air up® is so much more than a water bottle. As the world’s first refillable drinking system that flavors water through scent alone: it’s a hydration revolution. \n\nWhat's meant by this? Science shows that the majority of what we perceive as flavor is actually derived from scents. Our one-of-a-kind drinking system transports carefully-crafted flavors from our pods through the mouth all the way to your olfactory receptors - and that's when your brain perceives the scent as flavor. This is called “retronasal olfaction” - just drinking water, but perceiving it as a flavored beverage. Mind-blowing, we know. But it’s just science.* \n\nSince its launch in Europe in July 2019, air up® has grown into a company that operates in over 11 countries, has more than 300 employees, and enjoys a customer base in the millions.\n\nInterested in following the #thinknewdrinknew journey? Check us out on Facebook and Instagram. Let’s make scents of it [together].\n\n*Link to study regarding taste found here: https://flavourjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13411-015-0040-2#:~:text=It%20is%20frequently%20asserted%20that,from%20the%20sense%20of%20smell.

We’re here to help make refurbished tech trustworthy, reliable, and affordable. \n\nAs a certified B-Corp, Back Market’s mission is to do more with what we already have. Because, well, what we already have is pretty great. That’s why all the tech you find on Back Market is better than new — because not only is it in perfect working condition, independent scientific research shows that refurbished electronics have a significantly smaller footprint on the environment than brand new. Every time someone chooses refurbished tech, we avoid additional environmental impact on the planet.\n\nOf course, it’s not just about the tech sold by sellers on our marketplace, it’s also about how we run our business — we hold ourselves to high standards when it comes to our own sustainability practices, too. We work across the refurbishment industry to develop new technologies, support environmental initiatives related to electronic waste (e-waste), and work with local governments across the globe to pass legislation that supports sustainability and the Right to Repair in the tech industry. \n\n\nWe know we’re not alone in our vision for a world where tech respects the planet. With 884M€ raised to date and over 10 million customers around the world, we’re well on our way to the joyful revolution of Tech Reborn. \n\nAre you ready to join us? \n\n— \n\nLearn about the environmental impact of refurbished tech: https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/c/news/impact-of-refurbished-on-environment",
