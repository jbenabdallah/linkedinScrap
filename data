Tu aideras l'équipe à piloter l'activité commerciale avec des données claires.\n\nL'objectif de cette alternance, c'est que tu sortes avec une vraie compréhension du développement commercial dans le digital. À la fin, tu sauras prospecter, qualifier, et faire avancer des opportunités de A à Z.\n\n*Le profil qu'on recherche*\n\nTu es en formation supérieure en commerce, business development, marketing digital ou équivalent (niveau Bac+3 à Bac+5), et tu cherches une alternance où tu vas vraiment faire du commercial.\n\n*Ce qu'on attend de toi :*\n\n*L'aisance relationnelle* : tu aimes le contact humain, tu sais engager la conversation, tu es à l'aise au téléphone comme à l'écrit. Tu n'as pas peur de décrocher ton téléphone ou d'envoyer des messages à des inconnus.\n\n*L'organisation et la rigueur* : tu vas gérer plusieurs leads en parallèle, avec des relances à programmer, des suivis à faire. Il faut savoir où tu en es, ne rien laisser passer, et rester carré sur ton organisation.\n\n*La réactivité* : dans le commercial, la vitesse compte. Un lead qui attend trois jours avant d'avoir une réponse va voir ailleurs. Il faut savoir répondre vite, rebondir vite, avancer vite.\n\n*L'écoute et le sens de la qualification* : tout le monde n'est pas un bon client. Il faut savoir poser les bonnes questions, comprendre les besoins, et identifier rapidement si on peut vraiment aider ou pas. C'est un gain de temps pour tout le monde.\n\n*La motivation par le challenge* : le commercial, c'est un métier où tu vois tes résultats. Si tu aimes te fixer des objectifs et les dépasser, si tu aimes voir ton impact direct sur la croissance de l'entreprise, tu vas adorer.\n\n*L'envie d'apprendre le business development* : on ne cherche pas quelqu'un qui sait tout. On cherche quelqu'un qui veut apprendre, qui pose des questions, qui teste, qui s'améliore. Si tu veux comprendre comment on développe une agence, tu es au bon endroit.\n\n*Tu travailleras 100% en remote* : liberté totale sur ta localisation. On fonctionne en télétravail avec des outils et une organisation adaptée.\n\n*Tu participeras directement à la croissance de l'agence* : chaque lead que tu qualifies, chaque rendez-vous que tu organises, chaque client que tu aides à signer, c'est un impact direct sur notre développement. C'est motivant et valorisant.\n\n*Tu seras en contact avec des entrepreneurs inspirants* : nos clients sont des gens passionnés, qui construisent leur projet, qui ont de l'ambition. Certains sont très connus dans leur domaine. C'est enrichissant de parler avec eux.\n\n*Tu apprendras le business development dans le digital* : c'est un secteur porteur, avec des codes spécifiques. Tu comprendras comment on vend du service dans le marketing digital, comment on qualifie un besoin, comment on construit une relation commerciale.\n\n*Tu seras formé par des entrepreneurs qui closent eux-mêmes* : les fondateurs de Youfunnel gèrent la partie closing depuis le début. Ils te transmettront leurs techniques, leurs scripts, leurs réflexes commerciaux.\n\n*Tu auras un vrai rôle stratégique* : tu ne seras pas juste là pour envoyer des emails en masse. On veut que tu réfléchisses avec nous à comment mieux prospecter, mieux qualifier, mieux convertir. Tes idées comptent.\n\n*L'ambiance est saine* : on travaille sérieusement, mais sans pression toxique. On valorise la transparence, la communication claire et le respect mutuel.\n\nInformations pratiques\n\n*Type de contrat* : alternance (apprentissage ou professionnalisation)\n*Rythme* : adaptable selon ton école\n*Localisation* : 100% télétravail\n*Début* : dès que possible\n\n*Rémunération selon niveau d’études + âge*\n\n*Comment postuler ?*\n\nEnvoie-nous ton CV et quelques lignes pour nous expliquer pourquoi ce poste t'intéresse. Pas besoin de lettre de motivation formelle, juste quelques phrases sincères.\n\nSi tu as déjà une expérience en prospection, en relation client, ou en vente (même un job étudiant ou un stage court), n'hésite pas à nous le mentionner. On veut savoir ce qui te motive dans le commercial.\n\nOn étudie toutes les candidatures avec attention et on te répond, même si c'est négatif.\n\nType d'emploi : Alternance\n\nAvantages :\n* Flextime\n\nLieu du poste : Télétravail"}

In parallel, most crypto tokenomics have failed to deliver long-term fairness, favoring insiders over users.\n\nWe're here to change that.\n\nUsual is the first stablecoin protocol that gives back ownership and value to its users. By turning users into stakeholders, we're building a more equitable financial infrastructure — one where value flows back to the community.\n\nIn just a few months, we built and launched a full protocol from scratch, introduced a new kind of stablecoin backed by tokenized US Treasuries (USD0), its yield-bearing counterpart (USD0++), and a revenue-sharing governance token ($USUAL). The protocol reached $1.8B in TVL at its peak and continues to evolve with major product and governance upgrades.\n\nWe're a small, focused team of DeFi natives with a strong execution track record and a clear ambition to reshape how value circulates in crypto.\n\n Your Role\n\nWe're looking for a Product Designer to take full ownership of design and user experience for a new product stack being developed inside Usual Lab.\n\nThis is a foundational role: you'll be the design lead within a small, autonomous squad — bridging design and development to ensure the products you design are implemented seamlessly and deliver the intended user experience.\n\nYour mission will be to translate complex mechanisms into intuitive user journeys, build the design system from scratch, and work hand-in-hand with engineers to bring your work into production.\n\nYou'll own the entire product design scope — and also play an active role in grooming, ticketing, syncing with devs, and following up on design implementation to ensure quality and alignment.\n\nThis role is perfect for someone who thrives in early-stage, fast-paced environments and wants to build real DeFi products from 0 1.\n\n‍ You'll Work Within a Dedicated Squad\nStack/Project Lead\nProduct Designer (you)\nTech Lead (Solidity)\n1 Solidity Engineer\n1 Backend Engineer\n1 Frontend Engineer\n1 Quant\n\n You will\nDesign elegant, user-centered experiences for a new DeFi product, from onboarding to edge cases.\nOwn and build a clean, scalable design system that sets the tone for this stack.\nCraft flows, interfaces, and prototypes that make complex interactions feel intuitive.\nWork closely with developers during grooming and implementation to ensure designs are understood, built to spec, and optimized in production.\nLead user journey mapping, interface structure, and micro-interactions.\nBuild high-fidelity prototypes and iterate quickly based on feedback.\nMaintain close collaboration with the product lead and engineers to ensure smooth delivery from design to deployment.\nContribute to brand and interface design for related web pages or dashboards.\n\n You Have\n4+ years in product or UX/UI design, ideally with experience in fintech or DeFi.\nExperience designing for Web3 platforms (wallets, tokens, flows, DeFi user behaviors).\nStrong design craft: attention to layout, micro-interactions, responsiveness, accessibility.\nFluency with Figma — including auto-layout, components, and prototyping.\nAbility to explain design decisions clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\nBonus: Experience with Framer or similar tools for building lightweight marketing pages.\nBonus: Experience collaborating directly with engineers on delivery and QA.\n\n You Are\nAutonomous and proactive — you take ownership and push things forward.\nCurious and comfortable working with technical teams.\nA strong communicator who builds trust across design and engineering.\nNot afraid to start from a blank page and make decisions in ambiguous contexts.\nPassionate about DeFi, crypto, and building for real users.\n\n What Success Looks Like\nA thoughtful, consistent user experience that makes complex DeFi mechanisms feel effortless.\nA design system that's scalable and easy for devs to implement.\nSmooth, collaborative workflows between design and engineering — ensuring what's in production matches what's been designed.\nClear product flows, fast iteration, and tight handoff between design and engineering.\nYou're the go-to person for product design decisions — and a key contributor to delivery quality.\n\n Why Join Us?\nWork in a small, elite team at the frontier of DeFi.\nTake full ownership of a product experience from day one.\nShape a new product stack with autonomy and velocity.\nShip real products with impact — no red tape, no middle layers.\nCompetitive salary and token options.\nRemote-first, async-friendly culture."}

No excuses, no blame-shifting — if something needs fixing, we own it and make it better. This means stepping up, even when it’s not “your job.” If a ball is dropped, we pick it up. If a customer is unhappy, we fix it. If a process is broken, we redesign it. We don’t wait for someone else to solve it — we lead with accountability and expect the same from those around us.Craftsmanship Putting care and intention into every task, striving for excellence, and taking deep ownership of the quality and outcome of your work. Craftsmanship means never settling for “just fine.” We sweat the details because details compound. Whether it’s a product feature, an internal doc, or a sales call — we treat it as a reflection of our standards. We aim to deliver jaw-dropping customer experiences by being curious, meticulous, and proud of what we build — even when nobody’s watching.We are “majos”Be friendly &amp; have fun with your coworkers. Always be genuine &amp; honest, but kind. “Majo” is our way of saying: be a good human. Be approachable, helpful, and warm. We’re building something ambitious, and it’s easier (and more fun) when we enjoy the ride together. We give feedback with kindness, challenge each other with respect, and celebrate wins together without ego.Urgency with FocusCreate the highest impact in the shortest amount of time. Move fast, but in the right direction. We operate with speed because time is our most limited resource. But speed without focus is chaos. We prioritize ruthlessly, act decisively, and stay aligned. We aim for high leverage: the biggest results from the simplest, smartest actions. We’re running a high-speed marathon — not a sprint with no strategy.Talent Density and MeritocracyHire only people who can raise the average; ‘exceptional performance is the passing grade.’ Ability trumps seniority. We believe the best teams are built on talent density — every hire should raise the bar. We reward contribution, not titles or tenure. We give ownership to those who earn it, and we all hold each other to a high standard. A-players want to work with other A-players — that’s how we win.First-Principles ThinkingStrip a problem to physics-level facts, ignore industry dogma, rebuild the solution from scratch. We don’t copy-paste solutions. We go back to basics, ask why things are the way they are, and rebuild from the ground up if needed. This mindset pushes us to innovate, challenge stale assumptions, and move faster than incumbents. It’s how we build what others think is impossible.The personal data provided in your application and during the selection process will be processed by Happyrobot, Inc., acting as Data Controller.By sending us your CV, you consent to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of evaluating and selecting you as a candidate for the position.

What began as a mission to help restaurants better understand and serve their guests evolved into a powerful platform used by merchants around the world.\n\nWith best-in-class tools for marketing, operations, and guest experience — all deeply integrated with its industry-leading CRM — SevenRooms empowers operators to drive revenue, streamline operations, and deliver experiences that keep guests coming back.\n\nIn 2025, DoorDash acquired SevenRooms to strengthen its in-store strategy and expand its merchant-first offerings. The combination brings together DoorDash's scale, reach, and digital innovation with SevenRooms' in-store capabilities to support hospitality businesses across every channel — from discovery and delivery to on-premise dining.\n\nAs DoorDash builds out its in-store capabilities, SevenRooms plays a central role in enabling merchants to grow their businesses and connect more meaningfully with guests, whether they're ordering online or dining in. This move reflects DoorDash's broader commitment to empowering local businesses, fostering stronger connections between consumers and the places they love, and building technology that meets merchants — and their customers — wherever they are."}
