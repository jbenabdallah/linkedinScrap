Most organizations employ large teams and aging platforms to manually produce content, oversee discussions, and pull insights from fragmented conversations. Even with AI technology widely available, implementing a simple automation typically requires weeks, often resulting in a \"pilot\" that never reaches production. The consequences include wasted opportunities, exhausted personnel, and technology infrastructure unable to match the pace of contemporary business demands.IgniteTech is dismantling that framework. We replace manual workflows with self-optimizing, AI-driven systems that operate at 10x the scale and velocity.

This role puts you in charge of an AI product from start to finish: engaging with customers every week, deciding the roadmap, and deploying to production. Your dual focus: enable Kayako One to resolve support tickets autonomously and construct an AI‑driven sales pipeline that moves prospects from initial contact to closed deal. You own the technology stack, the product direction, the release schedule, and the business results.The broader industry isolates engineers from end users behind layers of \"process.\" We reject that model. No intermediary chain of product managers, designers, or customer success teams stands between you and the field. You'll lead weekly discovery sessions, convert customer challenges into product requirements, release iteratively, and track measurable outcomes. You'll also build the AI sales automation framework that may serve as the blueprint for Trilogy's portfolio‑wide go‑to‑market. Here, success is measured by adoption metrics, resolution rates, customer satisfaction scores, and pipeline velocity.This position means owning the entire system: developing new AI capabilities in Kayako One to improve ticket resolution; building integrations with CRM and ticketing systems; designing outreach workflows and targeting algorithms; creating pipeline connectors; producing reports that validate effectiveness; and managing deployments, monitoring, and incident handling to ensure uptime. This is not a backend‑only role executing pre‑defined tickets, nor a comfortable lane with hand‑offs. You'll write production code as required, configure AWS infrastructure expertly, adopt tools such as Voiceflow or Cursor seamlessly, and ensure LLMs perform reliably in production rather than merely impressing in demos.You'll operate at the leading edge of our help desk product and an AI sales automation initiative, with visibility across the portfolio. Success means customers actively use your releases, resolutions accelerate, end users report higher satisfaction, and the pipeline becomes cleaner and faster.

We've proven the model works with thousands of learners. Now we need to scale it to millions across the Global South.\n\nThe skills gap in the Global South is massive. There are three billion people under the age of 25 who need to be trained for the AI-driven tech workforce, and schools don’t know how to keep up. We've solved the product challenge by harnessing the engagement of game-making, the multidisciplinary nature of games, and the power of community with peer learning to deliver an education that gets better with scale. Now we need someone who can solve the distribution challenge. We have partnered with entities that can scale this to entire countries, but we need an ambitious strategy for growth and a steward for these and new partnerships.\n\nIf we succeed, you'll have proven you can scale educational access across entire nations: a rare, career-defining experience.\n\nThe Role\n\nAs Chief Growth Officer, you'll deliver a life-changing learning opportunity into the hands of millions.
