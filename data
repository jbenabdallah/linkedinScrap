Our current team is distributed between GMT-8 and GMT+2 so we currently only hire in these timezones. 🎤 Interview process: Read more about our interview process. 🖥️ Team: Sales &amp; Customer Success💼 Manager: Magda Olszewska💰 Compensation: Please check our compensation calculator. 🦔 Read more about how we hire and how we think about Diversity &amp; Inclusion. About PostHogWe're shipping every product that companies need to run their business from their first day, to the day they IPO, and beyond. The operating system for folks who build software.We started with open-source product analytics, launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort. We've since shipped more than a dozen products, including:A built-in data warehouse, so users can query product and customer data together using custom SQL insights. A customer data platform, so they can send their data wherever they need with ease. PostHog AI, an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries. Next on the roadmap are CRM, messaging, revenue analytics, and support products. When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it!We are:Product-led. More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit. Default alive. Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on. Well-funded. We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top investors. We're set up for a long, ambitious journey. We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and being as weird as possible.Things We Care AboutTransparency: Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our public company handbook. Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions. Autonomy: We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. Engineers lead product teams and make product decisions. Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed. Shipping fast: Why not now? We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams – autonomous, highly-efficient groups of cracked engineers who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end. Time for building: Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication – PRs &gt; Issues &gt; Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are meeting-free days, and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had. Ambition: We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there. Being weird: Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping literally every product that relates to customer data. It means building an objectively unnecessary developer toy with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun. Job SummaryWe're looking for someone who is obsessed with helping to make customers successful. You'll be working with our users at a critical stage - the very start of their PostHog journey. By getting in early and helping them ensure they're using PostHog in the best possible way, you'll both help us retain customers and help them build better products.Most of our customers are highly technical and willing to self-serve, so they expect someone who understands their stack and whom they can trust, not a sales-y person with vague ideas. You’ll be the first human touchpoint for many high-potential customers, helping them implement PostHog correctly, get maximum value, and achieve their goals. And if they're spending too much money - well, you'll help them reduce their bills too!The Onboarding team is one of the newest teams at Posthog, so it’s a great time to join now! You’ll have opportunities to take full ownership, influence our tooling, define what an “excellent onboarding” looks like at PostHog, and meaningfully impact our revenue engine.What you'll be doingPerforming health checks on the implementation of customers who are about to pay their first bill with PostHog, using the usage data we track internally. Reaching out to these customers proactively to ensure they’re set up for success and that they see value from PostHog from day one. Educate customers on the products they aren’t using yet, helping them understand how to reach their goals with PostHog. Building and refining internal tools, improving processes, and writing queries for internal metrics. Work with the wider Sales and Customer Success teams to identify and hand off potential larger customers who require more focus and a deeper partnership. RequirementsTechnical depth. You don’t need to be a developer, but you should have a technical background or experience working closely with engineers. You’ll need to understand and advise on SDKs, data pipelines, and how to implement PostHog into customers’ existing stack. You know how to guide customers through complex setups. Strong customer focus. You enjoy talking with people and translating technical concepts into human language. You are passionate about helping our users, and you know how to make them use the product in a meaningful way. Commercially-minded. You're not just solving problems, you're thinking about providing value, increasing product adoption, and long-term retention. You care about improving processes and tools and maintaining excellent work hygiene. Nice to haveExperience working with similar technologies, ie, developer tools more broadly, or specifically product analytics, session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, data warehouses, or data pipelines. You’ve been in a pre-sales, technical account manager, or support-type role (hands-on technical problem-solving), bringing both technical expertise and commercial acumen. Experience with SQL, ie, understanding and writing queries. Experience with APIs or scripting. If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate!"}

You'll report to the Customer Success Lead and Head of Customer Success, and work alongside a tight-knit team: Juliette, António, Laura, May, Giovanni (Customer Success), and Ana (Account Manager).RequirementsAt Hunter, Customer Success is a core part of how we grow.Even though our product is designed to be simple and intuitive, there are moments where users need a hand to get started, troubleshoot an issue, or understand how Hunter fits into their workflow. Those interactions make a real difference for retention, upgrades, and long-term customer trust.In this role, your goal is to help users get as much value as possible from Hunter. That means handling inbound support, but also proactively reaching out to users who could benefit from guidance, best practices, or onboarding help.How Support Works At HunterWe provide support through Intercom (email + chat). Today, more than 70% of conversations are resolved by AI without needing a human.Your focus will be on higher-complexity questions, edge cases, sales-related requests, and anything that calls for deeper reasoning or a more personal touch. Because of that, you should be comfortable working alongside AI agents: using them daily, spotting gaps, and helping train or improve them over time.Support at Hunter is also tightly connected to product. You'll regularly test features, surface insights, and help shape what we build next. Caring about user experience and having some UI/UX sensitivity is a real plus.Support is the foundation, but not the full journey.After an initial period focused on support to get fully familiar with Hunter, our tools, and our users, everyone in Customer Success takes ownership of a specific area.

Product feedback and reporting: track user suggestions in Linear, escalate bugs to our Product team, and make sure users are kept in the loop. Customer onboarding and retention: identify users who might need help getting started or maximizing their plan, and reach out proactively to guide them. Upsell opportunities: spot inbound qualified upsell leads (for example for our Data Platform or Enterprise plan) and forward them to the Account Management team. Internal processes: help improve support by tagging conversations, refreshing saved replies, and keeping our documentation accurate and up to date. Knowledge sharing: stay on top of product updates and participate in our product webinars every two weeks.
