Type of work: Full-time (contractor or employee depending on circumstances). Level: IC4 or above. We're a remote company, we prefer asynchronous communication over meetings. The CompanyMUI's story began in 2014 with Material UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design. Today, Material UI stands as one of the most popular open-source libraries on GitHub and has paved the way for the fully-fledged startup known as MUI (founded in 2019), which now boasts an ever-expanding ecosystem of React UI products.We're a company of 35+ people as of early 2024, and we're growing.The productsMUI is best known for our flagship product, Material UI—but this is just one of three core component libraries we maintain. Base UI is our headless component library, and Pigment CSS is a zero-runtime CSS-in-JS styling engine. We also host Design Kits and pre-built Templates.Beyond the core libraries, MUI X offers advanced components like the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, and Charts, for more complex user interactions and data visualization needs.We're also making ambitious moves to incorporate our full suite of components into Toolpad, a low-code admin builder tool for assembling full-stack apps faster than ever.Learn more about MUI's products in this blog post: An introduction to the MUI ecosystem.The cultureMUI is a fully remote company with a team that spans the globe. The majority of our work is asynchronous, and we rely on written communication to collaborate. We're radically transparent: nearly all of our work happens in public. Each contributor has the freedom to decide how and when they work, and that work is primarily self-directed: it's your responsibility to define and complete your own tasks in a timely manner.For additional details about the culture, you can check our careers and about pages and also our public Handbook.Why we're hiringCurrently, 100% of MUI’s sales are inbound, and MUI boasts an impressive existing client base, with millions of developers having already downloaded MUI.MUI now needs to recruit a Senior Account Executive who can lead the transition to outbound sales while also building and implementing sales processes and methodologies as the company expands.This Senior Account Executive is not focused on aggressive hunting; instead, it is about being proactive in pursuing and creating deals and implementing sales frameworks with customers. This is a key hire for MUI because it involves collaborating with the leadership team to determine how sales can best support MUI.To accelerate this growth, MUI needs to hire a Senior Account Executive, who, as MUI’s first senior sales hire, will not only be responsible for selling MUI’s products but will also primarily focus on defining, building, and implementing MUI’s sales strategy and processes.Why this is interestingAs MUI continues to grow, the Senior Account Executive will not only close inbound leads, but will also work closely with both MUI customers and the MUI leadership team to define and implement sales strategies that increase average customer spending, renewal rates, and total contract value.The roleThe Senior Account Executives aim will be towards implementing the strategies that lead to MUI’s transition from a pure inbound sales business, into a hybrid inbound and outbound sales model.Key ResponsibilitiesDepending on the day, you'll:Hands-on Sales: Actively engage in the full sales cycle, from lead generation and qualification to closing deals and managing client relationships.

Who We're Looking ForAs our Senior Account Executive, you'll be a key player in our growth story. You'll not only be a hands-on sales contributor, closing deals and building relationships with key clients, but you'll also be responsible for building the entire sales function. This includes leading the hiring process for future sales team members, developing and implementing our sales strategy, defining sales roles, and fostering a high-performing sales culture.RequiredThe goal for the Senior Account Executive would be to progress and transition into the Sales team lead for MUI.

To manage existing customers and qualify incoming leads with a focus on selling additional licenses, upselling/cross-selling, and increasing total contract value – building strong relationships with each customer. The Senior Account Executive will manage key customers with large accounts, and scan existing smaller accounts to upsell into them.

No excuses, no blame-shifting — if something needs fixing, we own it and make it better. This means stepping up, even when it’s not “your job.” If a ball is dropped, we pick it up. If a customer is unhappy, we fix it. If a process is broken, we redesign it. We don’t wait for someone else to solve it — we lead with accountability and expect the same from those around us.Craftsmanship Putting care and intention into every task, striving for excellence, and taking deep ownership of the quality and outcome of your work. Craftsmanship means never settling for “just fine.” We sweat the details because details compound. Whether it’s a product feature, an internal doc, or a sales call — we treat it as a reflection of our standards. We aim to deliver jaw-dropping customer experiences by being curious, meticulous, and proud of what we build — even when nobody’s watching.We are “majos”Be friendly &amp; have fun with your coworkers. Always be genuine &amp; honest, but kind. “Majo” is our way of saying: be a good human. Be approachable, helpful, and warm. We’re building something ambitious, and it’s easier (and more fun) when we enjoy the ride together. We give feedback with kindness, challenge each other with respect, and celebrate wins together without ego.Urgency with FocusCreate the highest impact in the shortest amount of time. Move fast, but in the right direction. We operate with speed because time is our most limited resource. But speed without focus is chaos. We prioritize ruthlessly, act decisively, and stay aligned. We aim for high leverage: the biggest results from the simplest, smartest actions. We’re running a high-speed marathon — not a sprint with no strategy.Talent Density and MeritocracyHire only people who can raise the average; ‘exceptional performance is the passing grade.’ Ability trumps seniority. We believe the best teams are built on talent density — every hire should raise the bar. We reward contribution, not titles or tenure. We give ownership to those who earn it, and we all hold each other to a high standard. A-players want to work with other A-players — that’s how we win.First-Principles ThinkingStrip a problem to physics-level facts, ignore industry dogma, rebuild the solution from scratch. We don’t copy-paste solutions. We go back to basics, ask why things are the way they are, and rebuild from the ground up if needed. This mindset pushes us to innovate, challenge stale assumptions, and move faster than incumbents. It’s how we build what others think is impossible.The personal data provided in your application and during the selection process will be processed by Happyrobot, Inc., acting as Data Controller.By sending us your CV, you consent to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of evaluating and selecting you as a candidate for the position.
