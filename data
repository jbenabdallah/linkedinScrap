De nombreuses recherches montrent que certaines personnes ont tendance à se dévaloriser plus que d’autres, et à ne pas postuler lorsqu’elles ne cochent pas toutes les cases d’une fiche de poste.\n\nA travers cette description, nous essayons de te donner assez d’éléments sur la mission, le quotidien et l’environnement de ce poste pour te permettre de nous dire toi-même si tu penses a) t’épanouir chez nous et b) apporter de la valeur à notre projet.\nSi tu hésites, nous t’encourageons à candidater quand même : dans le pire des cas, tu auras perdu quelques minutes, et dans le meilleur, ce sera peut-être le début d’une longue et belle collaboration.\n\nNous tenons aussi à rappeler que nous mettons un point d’honneur à fournir les mêmes opportunités à chaque candidat•e, indépendamment de son origine, son sexe, ses aptitudes ou les traits qui le•la définissent.

Most organizations employ large teams and aging platforms to manually produce content, oversee discussions, and pull insights from fragmented conversations.

This role puts you in charge of an AI product from start to finish: engaging with customers every week, deciding the roadmap, and deploying to production. Your dual focus: enable Kayako One to resolve support tickets autonomously and construct an AI‑driven sales pipeline that moves prospects from initial contact to closed deal. You own the technology stack, the product direction, the release schedule, and the business results.The broader industry isolates engineers from end users behind layers of \"process.\" We reject that model. No intermediary chain of product managers, designers, or customer success teams stands between you and the field. You'll lead weekly discovery sessions, convert customer challenges into product requirements, release iteratively, and track measurable outcomes. You'll also build the AI sales automation framework that may serve as the blueprint for Trilogy's portfolio‑wide go‑to‑market. Here, success is measured by adoption metrics, resolution rates, customer satisfaction scores, and pipeline velocity.This position means owning the entire system: developing new AI capabilities in Kayako One to improve ticket resolution; building integrations with CRM and ticketing systems; designing outreach workflows and targeting algorithms; creating pipeline connectors; producing reports that validate effectiveness; and managing deployments, monitoring, and incident handling to ensure uptime. This is not a backend‑only role executing pre‑defined tickets, nor a comfortable lane with hand‑offs. You'll write production code as required, configure AWS infrastructure expertly, adopt tools such as Voiceflow or Cursor seamlessly, and ensure LLMs perform reliably in production rather than merely impressing in demos.You'll operate at the leading edge of our help desk product and an AI sales automation initiative, with visibility across the portfolio. Success means customers actively use your releases, resolutions accelerate, end users report higher satisfaction, and the pipeline becomes cleaner and faster. If you want to own business outcomes, engage with customers weekly, filter out distractions, and ship what truly moves the needle, this opportunity is for you.What You Will Be DoingDevelop and deploy Kayako One capabilities—AI‑powered ticket resolution improvements, CRM and ticketing platform integrations, scalable and reliable infrastructure, plus performance optimizations and bug remediation.Conduct weekly customer discovery sessions to extract genuine pain points, translate them into product requirements, and validate direction with real users.Construct the AI sales automation platform—design outreach workflows, integrate pipeline and sales tools, automate stage progression, and build performance dashboards.Manage deployment and operational excellence—execute full‑stack releases, implement monitoring/alerting/incident response, and maintain AWS infrastructure and database systems.What You Won’t Be DoingThis is not simply coding to specifications given to you — you define what gets built based on direct customer feedback.This is not work that remains in staging environments — every feature you create reaches production and real users.This is not narrow technical specialization — you are accountable for the entire stack, infrastructure, and end‑user experience.Senior AI Engineer Key ResponsibilitiesDevelop and sustain an AI‑powered customer support system capable of resolving tickets without human interventionDevelop and sustain a complete AI sales pipeline that advances opportunities from initial contact through deal closureBasic RequirementsMinimum 5 years of professional software development experienceTrack record of owning complete products or major systems, not merely isolated featuresProven history of shipping AI/LLM‑powered products to production (beyond prototypes or demonstrations)Extensive AWS expertise, including Lambda, S3, OpenSearch, RDS, CloudWatch, EventBridge, EC2, Route 53, CloudFrontHands‑on LLM/AI integration work, including Claude/ChatGPT prompt engineering and API integrationProficiency in Python, Java, and JavaScriptWorking knowledge of MySQL databasePractical experience with Docker, deployment pipelines, and GitHub workflowsFamiliarity with OpenAI and JWT API developmentExperience managing DNS and web infrastructureDirect customer‑facing experienceAbout TrilogyHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform.
