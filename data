You champion ethical analytics and know how to turn privacy into a product advantage.\n\n- Cross-Functional Guru: Working seamlessly with Sales, Marketing, Engineering, and Customer Success teams across multiple time zones is your superpower. You’re a collaborative force that breaks down silos.\n\n- Analytical Innovator: You balance intuition with data-driven decision-making, always validating your assumptions and measuring success.

Europe to understand their full ecosystem — from procurement and compliance to workflows, integrations, and user outcomes.\n\n- Apply human-centred design and design thinking to uncover unmet needs and pain points.\n\n- Map and prioritise buyer personas and user needs to influence product roadmaps and guide go-to-market alignment.\n\n- Run co-creation workshops and design sprints to ideate and

In parallel, most crypto tokenomics have failed to deliver long-term fairness, favoring insiders over users.\n\nWe're here to change that.\n\nUsual is the first stablecoin protocol that gives back ownership and value to its users. By turning users into stakeholders, we're building a more equitable financial infrastructure — one where value flows back to the community.\n\nIn just a few months, we built and launched a full protocol from scratch, introduced a new kind of stablecoin backed by tokenized US Treasuries (USD0), its yield-bearing counterpart (USD0++), and a revenue-sharing governance token ($USUAL). The protocol reached $1.8B in TVL at its peak and continues to evolve with major product and governance upgrades.\n\nWe're a small, focused team of DeFi natives with a strong execution track record and a clear ambition to reshape how value circulates in crypto.\n\n Your Role\n\nWe're looking for a Product Designer to take full ownership of design and user experience for a new product stack being developed inside Usual Lab.\n\nThis is a foundational role: you'll be the design lead within a small, autonomous squad — bridging design and development to ensure the products you design are implemented seamlessly and deliver the intended user experience.\n\nYour mission will be to translate complex mechanisms into intuitive user journeys, build the design system from scratch, and work hand-in-hand with engineers to bring your work into production.\n\nYou'll own the entire product design scope — and also play an active role in grooming, ticketing, syncing with devs, and following up on design implementation to ensure quality and alignment.\n\nThis role is perfect for someone who thrives in early-stage, fast-paced environments and wants to build real DeFi products from 0 1.\n\n‍ You'll Work Within a Dedicated Squad\nStack/Project Lead\nProduct Designer (you)\nTech Lead (Solidity)\n1 Solidity Engineer\n1 Backend Engineer\n1 Frontend Engineer\n1 Quant\n\n You will\nDesign elegant, user-centered experiences for a new DeFi product, from onboarding to edge cases.\nOwn and build a clean, scalable design system that sets the tone for this stack.\nCraft flows, interfaces, and prototypes that make complex interactions feel intuitive.\nWork closely with developers during grooming and implementation to ensure designs are understood, built to spec, and optimized in production.\nLead user journey mapping, interface structure, and micro-interactions.\nBuild high-fidelity prototypes and iterate quickly based on feedback.\nMaintain close collaboration with the product lead and engineers to ensure smooth delivery from design to deployment.\nContribute to brand and interface design for related web pages or dashboards.\n\n You Have\n4+ years in product or UX/UI design, ideally with experience in fintech or DeFi.\nExperience designing for Web3 platforms (wallets, tokens, flows, DeFi user behaviors).\nStrong design craft: attention to layout, micro-interactions, responsiveness, accessibility.\nFluency with Figma — including auto-layout, components, and prototyping.\nAbility to explain design decisions clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\nBonus: Experience with Framer or similar tools for building lightweight marketing pages.\nBonus: Experience collaborating directly with engineers on delivery and QA.\n\n You Are\nAutonomous and proactive — you take ownership and push things forward.\nCurious and comfortable working with technical teams.\nA strong communicator who builds trust across design and engineering.\nNot afraid to start from a blank page and make decisions in ambiguous contexts.\nPassionate about DeFi, crypto, and building for real users.\n\n What Success Looks Like\nA thoughtful, consistent user experience that makes complex DeFi mechanisms feel effortless.\nA design system that's scalable and easy for devs to implement.\nSmooth, collaborative workflows between design and engineering — ensuring what's in production matches what's been designed.\nClear product flows, fast iteration, and tight handoff between design and engineering.\nYou're the go-to person for product design decisions — and a key contributor to delivery quality.\n\n Why Join Us?\nWork in a small, elite team at the frontier of DeFi.\nTake full ownership of a product experience from day one.\nShape a new product stack with autonomy and velocity.\nShip real products with impact — no red tape, no middle layers.\nCompetitive salary and token options.\nRemote-first, async-friendly culture."}

We fine‑tune every touchpoint to deliver a seamless experience. Our latest innovation brings video into menus: not just visuals, but a way to build trust through transparency and spotlight the craft behind every dish.\n\nOur mission goes beyond the guest experience. We build dedicated tools that empower teams, like our best‑in‑class payment terminal built for hospitality, saving servers valuable time. We also share real‑time guest reviews so teams can track satisfaction and improve their shift instantly. Hospitality is demanding: that’s what drives us. It pushes us to move fast, think smart, and raise the bar every day. As our business grows, so do our teams. We’re looking for people who can help us scale and bring structure without slowing us down.\n\n About the Role\n\nJoin our 3rd‑party POS Integrations team. Our mission is to deliver a product that is more stable and predictable than the upstream systems it relies on. You’ll design and build the protective layer between sunday and a diverse ecosystem of POS vendors: implementing resilience, data quality, and observability so guests and merchants get a consistent experience regardless of vendor quirks or outages.\n\nWhile you’ll focus on back‑end systems, you’re comfortable venturing across the stack when needed: making small changes to front‑end flows and touching infrastructure to ship end‑to‑end improvements.\n\n Key Responsibilities\nElevate stability and cohesion across integrations to deliver a unified, high‑quality experience for merchants and guests.\nLead architectural decisions for scalability, resilience, and maintainability (e.g., idempotency, retries with backoff, circuit breakers, DLQs, backpressure, rate limiting, graceful degradation).\nPitch in beyond back‑end when needed: small UI fixes in our admin/ops panels and light infra changes (pipelines, configs, IaC) to unblock delivery.\nDesign clear API contracts and schemas (REST/gRPC) and evolve them safely over time with versioning and ADRs.\nRaise the bar on observability: define SLOs/error budgets, improve logs/traces/metrics (Datadog or equivalent), add synthetic checks, and build actionable dashboards/runbooks.\nOwn data correctness and reconciliation across eventually consistent, distributed systems (outbox/inbox patterns, deduplication, replays, CDC, re‑sync jobs).\nDebug complex incidents end‑to‑end across our services and third‑party vendors; drive root‑cause analysis and long‑term fixes; analyze and solve memory leaks and related issues.\nPartner with Product, Support, and Integrations/CS teams to turn real‑world issues and merchant feedback into roadmap value.\nMentor engineers and contribute to shared tooling, documentation, and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).\nShip fast, safely using CI/CD, feature flags, canaries, and incremental rollouts.\n\n About You\nOutcome‑driven and comfortable in fast, evolving contexts: you ship results, not just code.\nEnd‑to‑end ownership: shaping problems, delivering clean solutions, and ensuring smooth production operations.\nLead by example: mentoring, improving practices, and aligning teams on a clear architecture and standards.\nStrong back‑end proficiency with Java/Kotlin/Spring and scalable integration architectures.\nFluent in testing strategies for integrations: unit/integration and non‑prod vendor mocks/sandboxes.\nSkilled at performance analysis and observability‑driven debugging across distributed systems.\nComfortable making small front‑end changes (React) and light infra adjustments (CI/CD, Helm/Terraform/config) to ship holistic improvements.\nClear communicator in writing and in real time, and you know when a quick call or pairing session beats a long thread\n\nNice to have\nExperience with POS ecosystems (e.g., Toast, Lightspeed, Oracle Micros, NCR Aloha, L’Addition, TISSL, etc.).\nEvent‑driven systems (Kafka/RabbitMQ), stream/batch data flows, and stateful workflows (saga/orchestration).\nSecurity for integrations: OAuth2/mTLS/API keys, secrets management, webhook signature validation.\nPractical knowledge of caching, rate limiting, TTLs, and consistency strategies to balance latency and correctness.\n\n Why this role matters\n\nsunday is scaling across products, markets, and teams: and integrations are a force multiplier. This role ensures our experiences remain fast, delightful, and resilient even when upstream systems aren’t. You’ll help shape how we build and scale the integration layer so we can grow with confidence.\n\n️ Compensation, Perks & Benefits\nCompetitive salary (75-90k) and equity\nRemote‑first friendly culture\nThe chance to build products used by millions across the globe\n100% health coverage for you and your children\nFree vacation policy\nOpportunity for significant impact in shaping innovative product development within a high‑growth environment\n\n Equal Opportunity\n\nsunday is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, creed, color, sex, affectional or sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, ancestry, nationality, age, disability, marital status, veteran status, genetic information, or on any other basis prohibited by law (except where an attribute is a bona fide occupational qualification)."}

No excuses, no blame-shifting — if something needs fixing, we own it and make it better. This means stepping up, even when it’s not “your job.” If a ball is dropped, we pick it up. If a customer is unhappy, we fix it. If a process is broken, we redesign it. We don’t wait for someone else to solve it — we lead with accountability and expect the same from those around us.Craftsmanship Putting care and intention into every task, striving for excellence, and taking deep ownership of the quality and outcome of your work. Craftsmanship means never settling for “just fine.” We sweat the details because details compound. Whether it’s a product feature, an internal doc, or a sales call — we treat it as a reflection of our standards. We aim to deliver jaw-dropping customer experiences by being curious, meticulous, and proud of what we build — even when nobody’s watching.We are “majos”Be friendly &amp; have fun with your coworkers. Always be genuine &amp; honest, but kind. “Majo” is our way of saying: be a good human. Be approachable, helpful, and warm. We’re building something ambitious, and it’s easier (and more fun) when we enjoy the ride together. We give feedback with kindness, challenge each other with respect, and celebrate wins together without ego.Urgency with FocusCreate the highest impact in the shortest amount of time. Move fast, but in the right direction. We operate with speed because time is our most limited resource. But speed without focus is chaos. We prioritize ruthlessly, act decisively, and stay aligned. We aim for high leverage: the biggest results from the simplest, smartest actions. We’re running a high-speed marathon — not a sprint with no strategy.Talent Density and MeritocracyHire only people who can raise the average; ‘exceptional performance is the passing grade.’ Ability trumps seniority. We believe the best teams are built on talent density — every hire should raise the bar. We reward contribution, not titles or tenure. We give ownership to those who earn it, and we all hold each other to a high standard. A-players want to work with other A-players — that’s how we win.First-Principles ThinkingStrip a problem to physics-level facts, ignore industry dogma, rebuild the solution from scratch. We don’t copy-paste solutions. We go back to basics, ask why things are the way they are, and rebuild from the ground up if needed. This mindset pushes us to innovate, challenge stale assumptions, and move faster than incumbents. It’s how we build what others think is impossible.The personal data provided in your application and during the selection process will be processed by Happyrobot, Inc., acting as Data Controller.By sending us your CV, you consent to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of evaluating and selecting you as a candidate for the position.
