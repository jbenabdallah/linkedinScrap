Thanks to professionalism, reliability and quality of their products and services the company consolidates its market leadership from year to year. Experience and expertise in food packaging and food processing that the company has acquired in over 50 year, allow a 360 degree view on the market. Due to efficient synergies, skills and services are constantly improved for the benefit of customers. In 1952 Niederwieser Spa started its business in Italy selling meat processing machinery and equipment. The experience gained and the competence to identify the needs of the market induced the company to orientate itself also towards packaging and printing systems. The takeover of VF VERPACKUNGEN GmbH and its innovative extrusion technology for the production of special 11-layer films finally led to the completion of the product range.",

  "companyDescription": "air up® is so much more than a water bottle. As the world’s first refillable drinking system that flavors water through scent alone: it’s a hydration revolution. \n\nWhat's meant by this? Science shows that the majority of what we perceive as flavor is actually derived from scents. Our one-of-a-kind drinking system transports carefully-crafted flavors from our pods through the mouth all the way to your olfactory receptors - and that's when your brain perceives the scent as flavor. This is called “retronasal olfaction” - just drinking water, but perceiving it as a flavored beverage. Mind-blowing, we know. But it’s just science.* \n\nSince its launch in Europe in July 2019, air up® has grown into a company that operates in over 11 countries, has more than 300 employees, and enjoys a customer base in the millions.\n\nInterested in following the #thinknewdrinknew journey? Check us out on Facebook and Instagram. Let’s make scents of it [together].\n\n*Link to study regarding taste found here: https://flavourjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13411-015-0040-2#:~:text=It%20is%20frequently%20asserted%20that,from%20the%20sense%20of%20smell.

We’re here to help make refurbished tech trustworthy, reliable, and affordable. \n\nAs a certified B-Corp, Back Market’s mission is to do more with what we already have. Because, well, what we already have is pretty great. That’s why all the tech you find on Back Market is better than new — because not only is it in perfect working condition, independent scientific research shows that refurbished electronics have a significantly smaller footprint on the environment than brand new. Every time someone chooses refurbished tech, we avoid additional environmental impact on the planet.\n\nOf course, it’s not just about the tech sold by sellers on our marketplace, it’s also about how we run our business — we hold ourselves to high standards when it comes to our own sustainability practices, too. We work across the refurbishment industry to develop new technologies, support environmental initiatives related to electronic waste (e-waste), and work with local governments across the globe to pass legislation that supports sustainability and the Right to Repair in the tech industry. \n\n\nWe know we’re not alone in our vision for a world where tech respects the planet. With 884M€ raised to date and over 10 million customers around the world, we’re well on our way to the joyful revolution of Tech Reborn. \n\nAre you ready to join us? \n\n— \n\nLearn about the environmental impact of refurbished tech: https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/c/news/impact-of-refurbished-on-environment",
