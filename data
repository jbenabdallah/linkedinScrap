Evidence-backed proposals and measurable outcomes are your trademark.\n\nWhat You'll Lead and Execute\n\nCustomer-Centric Product Discovery\n\n- Engage directly with key enterprise customers across Europe to understand their full ecosystem — from procurement and compliance to workflows, integrations, and user outcomes.\n\n- Apply human-centred design and design thinking to uncover unmet needs and pain points.\n\n- Map and prioritise buyer personas and user needs to influence product roadmaps and guide go-to-market alignment.\n\n- Run co-creation workshops and design sprints to ideate and

validated solutions.\n\n- Collaborate with the Head of Product and Product Committee to align product strategy with customer needs, regional regulations, and competitive landscape.\n\n- Balance intuition and evidence using structured tools such as value sizing and cost-benefit assessments.\n\n- Navigate competing stakeholder inputs to drive prioritisation and alignment.\n\n- Drive roadmap execution across development squads, ensuring impact, responsiveness, and measurable outcomes.\n\n- Balance open-source and enterprise customer needs to maintain a cohesive, scalable platform

In parallel, most crypto tokenomics have failed to deliver long-term fairness, favoring insiders over users.\n\nWe're here to change that.\n\nUsual is the first stablecoin protocol that gives back ownership and value to its users. By turning users into stakeholders, we're building a more equitable financial infrastructure — one where value flows back to the community.\n\nIn just a few months, we built and launched a full protocol from scratch, introduced a new kind of stablecoin backed by tokenized US Treasuries (USD0), its yield-bearing counterpart (USD0++), and a revenue-sharing governance token ($USUAL). The protocol reached $1.8B in TVL at its peak and continues to evolve with major product and governance upgrades.\n\nWe're a small, focused team of DeFi natives with a strong execution track record and a clear ambition to reshape how value circulates in crypto.\n\n Your Role\n\nWe're looking for a Product Designer to take full ownership of design and user experience for a new product stack being developed inside Usual Lab.\n\nThis is a foundational role: you'll be the design lead within a small, autonomous squad — bridging design and development to ensure the products you design are implemented seamlessly and deliver the intended user experience.\n\nYour mission will be to translate complex mechanisms into intuitive user journeys, build the design system from scratch, and work hand-in-hand with engineers to bring your work into production.\n\nYou'll own the entire product design scope — and also play an active role in grooming, ticketing, syncing with devs, and following up on design implementation to ensure quality and alignment.\n\nThis role is perfect for someone who thrives in early-stage, fast-paced environments and wants to build real DeFi products from 0 1.\n\n‍ You'll Work Within a Dedicated Squad\nStack/Project Lead\nProduct Designer (you)\nTech Lead (Solidity)\n1 Solidity Engineer\n1 Backend Engineer\n1 Frontend Engineer\n1 Quant\n\n You will\nDesign elegant, user-centered experiences for a new DeFi product, from onboarding to edge cases.\nOwn and build a clean, scalable design system that sets the tone for this stack.\nCraft flows, interfaces, and prototypes that make complex interactions feel intuitive.\nWork closely with developers during grooming and implementation to ensure designs are understood, built to spec, and optimized in production.\nLead user journey mapping, interface structure, and micro-interactions.\nBuild high-fidelity prototypes and iterate quickly based on feedback.\nMaintain close collaboration with the product lead and engineers to ensure smooth delivery from design to deployment.\nContribute to brand and interface design for related web pages or dashboards.\n\n You Have\n4+ years in product or UX/UI design, ideally with experience in fintech or DeFi.\nExperience designing for Web3 platforms (wallets, tokens, flows, DeFi user behaviors).\nStrong design craft: attention to layout, micro-interactions, responsiveness, accessibility.\nFluency with Figma — including auto-layout, components, and prototyping.\nAbility to explain design decisions clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\nBonus: Experience with Framer or similar tools for building lightweight marketing pages.\nBonus: Experience collaborating directly with engineers on delivery and QA.\n\n You Are\nAutonomous and proactive — you take ownership and push things forward.\nCurious and comfortable working with technical teams.\nA strong communicator who builds trust across design and engineering.\nNot afraid to start from a blank page and make decisions in ambiguous contexts.\nPassionate about DeFi, crypto, and building for real users.\n\n What Success Looks Like\nA thoughtful, consistent user experience that makes complex DeFi mechanisms feel effortless.\nA design system that's scalable and easy for devs to implement.\nSmooth, collaborative workflows between design and engineering — ensuring what's in production matches what's been designed.\nClear product flows, fast iteration, and tight handoff between design and engineering.\nYou're the go-to person for product design decisions — and a key contributor to delivery quality.\n\n Why Join Us?\nWork in a small, elite team at the frontier of DeFi.\nTake full ownership of a product experience from day one.\nShape a new product stack with autonomy and velocity.\nShip real products with impact — no red tape, no middle layers.\nCompetitive salary and token options.\nRemote-first, async-friendly culture."}

Our chosen language for written communication is English.\n\nFrench: ideally bilingual.\n\nCurrently, 20% of the team is International, from the cherry blossoms of Japan, the Canadian lakes and to the forest of Madagascar.\n\nIT MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU\n-\n\nLet’s be clear, we are looking for someone who is not just Great, and for whom Paradox ambition isn’t just another cool project; but a true mission.\n\nSo if those personal interests : personal development / coaching / professional growth / education / edtech / teaching / edutainment are not things you REALLY love, let’s forget it!\n\nLet’s forget about it also if,\n\nYou don’t like to be challenged and grow in your job\n\nYou don't like receiving or giving tough feedbacks\n\nYou don’t question the status quo: the process are there for a reason, we have always done it this way\n\nYou like to have very specific & fixed tasks assigned to you. Be told what to do and how to do it.\n\nYour only driver is joining a full-remote company: yes, our company culture is cool, but we want people to care about our mission, products, and their job!\n\nJOIN US IF YOU CRAVE\n-\nGrowth & Ambition\n\nWe hire only the best, it’s exhilarating to be surrounded by A-players who strive to perform whilst being in a good mood. You'll be working with some of the best minds. We understand that \"A\" people attract \"A\" people.\n\nNo more bosses, but ongoing conversations to support your professional development.\n\n️ Being part of an ambitious company with a lot of growth opportunities\n\nImpact & Meaning\n\nPlaying a crucial role in the development of a company whose content and products are enjoyed by millions of people\nWaking up in the morning knowing you are making a difference: we receive messages every day from clients who have successfully lost weight, quit smoking, reach a mile stone in their business, built better relationships, and made positive changes in their lives.\n\nBut that’s not all, we believe that driven people deserve…\n\nFreedom & Well Being\n\nA company culture based on autonomy & accountability\nFlexible working hours\nA remote culture from day one with the freedom to work from wherever you want\nMagnificent offices in Dubai\nStanding desks paid by the company, if you live far from our offices\nMacbook: to be the most efficient in your work\n350€ per year paid by the company to take care of yourself (for your gym, or dance class or whatever make you feel great)\n150€ per year paid by the company to boost your knowledge (books, education): we are passionate about learning and want to support your growth)\n1:1 coachings: a Paradox coach supporting you personally or professionally to live your best life\nTeam building\n\n* those benefits are only for full-time employees\n\nHIRING PROCESS\n-\n\nThat job description resonated with you?\n\nHere is your tailor made hiring process\n\nA 6 to 8 minutes application survey (with a short video assignment)\n\nA 15–20 minute WhatsApp call with Chloé, our Talent Manager, to tell you more about the challenge and see if it fits your experience and expectations\n\nA video call with Chloé to deep dive into your career path and ambitions\n\nA video call with some C-level of the company to explore your skills and see how we can align your goals with our needs\n\nA culture-fit video call with Timy, our Culture Coach, to assess alignment with our values and mindset\n\nA meeting with our CEO - David, to ensure there is a match between you two.\n\nReference check to understand how you operate across environments and help set you up for a smooth onboarding\n\nWelcome aboard!\n\nAbout our hiring process\n\nOur recruitment process is tailored to do our best to avoid that you or us realize that we’re not a perfect fit. Every step serves a purpose and will allow us to get to know you better as much as it’ll help you understand more where you’ll be stepping in.\n\nWe also want you to have time to ask all of your questions regarding the mission, the long-term vision of your team and the company, our values, with the relevant interlocutor in front of you.\n\nBut maybe YOU WONDER WHAT’S OUR STORY ?\n\n-\n\nAt Paradox, we are convinced that people do not want “just a job” anymore.\n\nWe are all craving to have an impact through our professional journey. Some want to start their own venture, some want to become an intrapreneur in their current organization, some others just want their day-to-day tasks to have more meaning.\n\nPARADOX HAS ONE GOAL: TO EMPOWER PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS TO LIVE THEIR TRUE AMBITIONS.\n\nBut where do we start?\n\nIf you have an interest in personal development, you probably already know that:\n\nMaking things happen is a real struggle when you don’t know what truly inspires you and how to get there ;\n\nAvailable resources are either boring or full of crazy unsubstantiated theories .\n\nIt needs to change, and we’re here to make it happen!\n\n️ OUR AMBITION IS TO MAKE SUCCESS THE ONLY POSSIBLE OUTCOME FOR OUR CLIENTS (WHATEVER SUCCESS MEANS FOR THEM), BY CRAFTING INNOVATIVE & CAPTIVATING BREAKTHROUGH EXPERIENCES.\n\nIn other words, we want to make personal growth as entertaining as watching Netflix.\n\nHow, you might be wondering?\n\nWe travel the world and surround ourselves with top entrepreneurs (Richard Branson - Founder of Virgin, Marc Simoncini - Founder of Meeting, Fred Mazzella - Founder of BlablaCar), world athletes (Tony Parker - Hall of fame NBA Player, Frederick Bousquet - World record in 50m free swimming, Frank Leboeuf - WorldCup Footballer), and artists (Gad Elmaleh - Comedian, Franck Dubosc, Barry Osborne - Producer of Lord of the Rings and Matrix) ;\n\nWe reverse engineer their strategies for achieving success and fulfillment and lean on the latest researches about neurosciences ;\n\nWe deliver trainings & educational contents around Power Skills (critical thinking, productivity, leadership, public speaking, coaching, stress management, etc.), self-growth and performance, through a balanced set of e-learning programs, events and edutainment videos .\n\nFrom one well-known Founder to a team of +40 people today (and counting!), this approach has paid off and enabled us to exceed 2 million followers on social networks, and to have thousands of people attending our online events and training courses.\n\nTOGETHER, WE ARE DRIVEN BY ONE DREAM:\n\nHelping 100 000 people achieve their dream and display their pictures on what we call the “100 000 dreams wall” ;\n\nGiving our clients access to constant personal growth by reinventing their learning experience ;\n\nLeverage AI and other technology to provide an outstanding customized experience to millions of people for them to transform their lives.\n\nAnd that’s where you come in.
