Depuis le début, on fait la même chose : on construit des tunnels de vente qui fonctionnent vraiment et on lance des campagnes publicitaires qui ramènent des clients.\n\nConcrètement, on a accompagné plus de 100 entrepreneurs. Notre méthode a généré plus de 4,6 millions d'euros de chiffre d'affaires cumulé pour nos clients.\n\nNotre équipe est petite, volontairement. On préfère travailler à taille humaine. Pas de hiérarchie lourde, pas de process absurdes. Juste du travail bien fait, ensemble.\n\n*Le poste en quelques mots*\n\nOn cherche un alternant pour nous aider à développer notre activité commerciale. Youfunnel grandit, la demande est là, et on a besoin de structurer notre développement commercial pour aller chercher encore plus d'opportunités.\n\nCe poste, c'est une vraie immersion dans le business development. Tu vas apprendre à identifier les bons prospects, à entrer en contact avec eux, à qualifier leurs besoins, et à faire en sorte qu'ils deviennent clients. Tu seras un maillon essentiel de notre croissance.\n\n*Ce que tu feras concrètement*\n\n*Identifier et qualifier de nouveaux leads* : tu vas chercher activement de nouveaux prospects qui correspondent à notre profil client idéal. Coachs, consultants, infopreneurs qui ont besoin de nos services. Tu utiliseras LinkedIn, des bases de données, et ton sens de la recherche pour les dénicher.\n\n*Assurer le premier contact* : tu seras en charge de contacter ces prospects, par email, par message LinkedIn, parfois par téléphone. L'objectif, c'est d'engager la conversation, de comprendre leurs besoins, et de voir si on peut les aider.\n\n*Gérer les leads entrants* : on reçoit aussi des demandes de prospects qui nous contactent directement. Tu seras en première ligne pour leur répondre rapidement, comprendre leur situation, et qualifier leur projet.\n\n*Organiser les rendez-vous* : une fois qu'un lead est qualifié, tu organises un rendez-vous avec les fondateurs. Tu gères l'agenda, tu prépares le dossier, tu t'assures que tout est clair.\n\n*Alimenter et tenir à jour le CRM* : toutes les informations que tu récupères doivent être enregistrées proprement dans notre outil de gestion client. C'est toi qui gardes la base propre et exploitable.\n\n*Optimiser les process commerciaux* : au fil de l'eau, tu participeras à l'amélioration de notre approche. Quels messages fonctionnent le mieux ? Quelle fréquence de relance ? Quels canaux convertissent le plus ? Tu analyseras, tu proposeras, tu testeras.\n\n*Produire des reportings* : tu suivras les indicateurs clés : nombre de leads générés, taux de qualification, taux de conversion en rendez-vous. Tu aideras l'équipe à piloter l'activité commerciale avec des données claires.\n\nL'objectif de cette alternance, c'est que tu sortes avec une vraie compréhension du développement commercial dans le digital. À la fin, tu sauras prospecter, qualifier, et faire avancer des opportunités de A à Z.\n\n*Le profil qu'on recherche*\n\nTu es en formation supérieure en commerce, business development, marketing digital ou équivalent (niveau Bac+3 à Bac+5), et tu cherches une alternance où tu vas vraiment faire du commercial.\n\n*Ce qu'on attend de toi :*\n\n*L'aisance relationnelle* : tu aimes le contact humain, tu sais engager la conversation, tu es à l'aise au téléphone comme à l'écrit. Tu n'as pas peur de décrocher ton téléphone ou d'envoyer des messages à des inconnus.\n\n*L'organisation et la rigueur* : tu vas gérer plusieurs leads en parallèle, avec des relances à programmer, des suivis à faire. Il faut savoir où tu en es, ne rien laisser passer, et rester carré sur ton organisation.\n\n*La réactivité* : dans le commercial, la vitesse compte. Un lead qui attend trois jours avant d'avoir une réponse va voir ailleurs. Il faut savoir répondre vite, rebondir vite, avancer vite.\n\n*L'écoute et le sens de la qualification* : tout le monde n'est pas un bon client. Il faut savoir poser les bonnes questions, comprendre les besoins, et identifier rapidement si on peut vraiment aider ou pas. C'est un gain de temps pour tout le monde.\n\n*La motivation par le challenge* : le commercial, c'est un métier où tu vois tes résultats. Si tu aimes te fixer des objectifs et les dépasser, si tu aimes voir ton impact direct sur la croissance de l'entreprise, tu vas adorer.\n\n*L'envie d'apprendre le business development* : on ne cherche pas quelqu'un qui sait tout. On cherche quelqu'un qui veut apprendre, qui pose des questions, qui teste, qui s'améliore. Si tu veux comprendre comment on développe une agence, tu es au bon endroit.\n\n*Tu travailleras 100% en remote* : liberté totale sur ta localisation. On fonctionne en télétravail avec des outils et une organisation adaptée.\n\n*Tu participeras directement à la croissance de l'agence* : chaque lead que tu qualifies, chaque rendez-vous que tu organises, chaque client que tu aides à signer, c'est un impact direct sur notre développement. C'est motivant et valorisant.\n\n*Tu seras en contact avec des entrepreneurs inspirants* : nos clients sont des gens passionnés, qui construisent leur projet, qui ont de l'ambition. Certains sont très connus dans leur domaine. C'est enrichissant de parler avec eux.\n\n*Tu apprendras le business development dans le digital* : c'est un secteur porteur, avec des codes spécifiques. Tu comprendras comment on vend du service dans le marketing digital, comment on qualifie un besoin, comment on construit une relation commerciale.\n\n*Tu seras formé par des entrepreneurs qui closent eux-mêmes* : les fondateurs de Youfunnel gèrent la partie closing depuis le début. Ils te transmettront leurs techniques, leurs scripts, leurs réflexes commerciaux.\n\n*Tu auras un vrai rôle stratégique* : tu ne seras pas juste là pour envoyer des emails en masse. On veut que tu réfléchisses avec nous à comment mieux prospecter, mieux qualifier, mieux convertir. Tes idées comptent.\n\n*L'ambiance est saine* : on travaille sérieusement, mais sans pression toxique. On valorise la transparence, la communication claire et le respect mutuel.\n\nInformations pratiques\n\n*Type de contrat* : alternance (apprentissage ou professionnalisation)\n*Rythme* : adaptable selon ton école\n*Localisation* : 100% télétravail\n*Début* : dès que possible\n\n*Rémunération selon niveau d’études + âge*\n\n*Comment postuler ?*\n\nEnvoie-nous ton CV et quelques lignes pour nous expliquer pourquoi ce poste t'intéresse. Pas besoin de lettre de motivation formelle, juste quelques phrases sincères.\n\nSi tu as déjà une expérience en prospection, en relation client, ou en vente (même un job étudiant ou un stage court), n'hésite pas à nous le mentionner. On veut savoir ce qui te motive dans le commercial.\n\nOn étudie toutes les candidatures avec attention et on te répond, même si c'est négatif.\n\nType d'emploi : Alternance\n\nAvantages :\n* Flextime\n\nLieu du poste : Télétravail"}

In parallel, most crypto tokenomics have failed to deliver long-term fairness, favoring insiders over users.\n\nWe're here to change that.\n\nUsual is the first stablecoin protocol that gives back ownership and value to its users. By turning users into stakeholders, we're building a more equitable financial infrastructure — one where value flows back to the community.\n\nIn just a few months, we built and launched a full protocol from scratch, introduced a new kind of stablecoin backed by tokenized US Treasuries (USD0), its yield-bearing counterpart (USD0++), and a revenue-sharing governance token ($USUAL). The protocol reached $1.8B in TVL at its peak and continues to evolve with major product and governance upgrades.\n\nWe're a small, focused team of DeFi natives with a strong execution track record and a clear ambition to reshape how value circulates in crypto.\n\n Your Role\n\nWe're looking for a Product Designer to take full ownership of design and user experience for a new product stack being developed inside Usual Lab.\n\nThis is a foundational role: you'll be the design lead within a small, autonomous squad — bridging design and development to ensure the products you design are implemented seamlessly and deliver the intended user experience.\n\nYour mission will be to translate complex mechanisms into intuitive user journeys, build the design system from scratch, and work hand-in-hand with engineers to bring your work into production.\n\nYou'll own the entire product design scope — and also play an active role in grooming, ticketing, syncing with devs, and following up on design implementation to ensure quality and alignment.\n\nThis role is perfect for someone who thrives in early-stage, fast-paced environments and wants to build real DeFi products from 0 1.\n\n‍ You'll Work Within a Dedicated Squad\nStack/Project Lead\nProduct Designer (you)\nTech Lead (Solidity)\n1 Solidity Engineer\n1 Backend Engineer\n1 Frontend Engineer\n1 Quant\n\n You will\nDesign elegant, user-centered experiences for a new DeFi product, from onboarding to edge cases.\nOwn and build a clean, scalable design system that sets the tone for this stack.\nCraft flows, interfaces, and prototypes that make complex interactions feel intuitive.\nWork closely with developers during grooming and implementation to ensure designs are understood, built to spec, and optimized in production.\nLead user journey mapping, interface structure, and micro-interactions.\nBuild high-fidelity prototypes and iterate quickly based on feedback.\nMaintain close collaboration with the product lead and engineers to ensure smooth delivery from design to deployment.\nContribute to brand and interface design for related web pages or dashboards.\n\n You Have\n4+ years in product or UX/UI design, ideally with experience in fintech or DeFi.\nExperience designing for Web3 platforms (wallets, tokens, flows, DeFi user behaviors).\nStrong design craft: attention to layout, micro-interactions, responsiveness, accessibility.\nFluency with Figma — including auto-layout, components, and prototyping.\nAbility to explain design decisions clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\nBonus: Experience with Framer or similar tools for building lightweight marketing pages.\nBonus: Experience collaborating directly with engineers on delivery and QA.\n\n You Are\nAutonomous and proactive — you take ownership and push things forward.\nCurious and comfortable working with technical teams.\nA strong communicator who builds trust across design and engineering.\nNot afraid to start from a blank page and make decisions in ambiguous contexts.\nPassionate about DeFi, crypto, and building for real users.\n\n What Success Looks Like\nA thoughtful, consistent user experience that makes complex DeFi mechanisms feel effortless.\nA design system that's scalable and easy for devs to implement.\nSmooth, collaborative workflows between design and engineering — ensuring what's in production matches what's been designed.\nClear product flows, fast iteration, and tight handoff between design and engineering.\nYou're the go-to person for product design decisions — and a key contributor to delivery quality.\n\n Why Join Us?\nWork in a small, elite team at the frontier of DeFi.\nTake full ownership of a product experience from day one.\nShape a new product stack with autonomy and velocity.\nShip real products with impact — no red tape, no middle layers.\nCompetitive salary and token options.\nRemote-first, async-friendly culture."}

No excuses, no blame-shifting — if something needs fixing, we own it and make it better. This means stepping up, even when it’s not “your job.” If a ball is dropped, we pick it up. If a customer is unhappy, we fix it. If a process is broken, we redesign it. We don’t wait for someone else to solve it — we lead with accountability and expect the same from those around us.Craftsmanship Putting care and intention into every task, striving for excellence, and taking deep ownership of the quality and outcome of your work. Craftsmanship means never settling for “just fine.” We sweat the details because details compound. Whether it’s a product feature, an internal doc, or a sales call — we treat it as a reflection of our standards. We aim to deliver jaw-dropping customer experiences by being curious, meticulous, and proud of what we build — even when nobody’s watching.We are “majos”Be friendly &amp; have fun with your coworkers. Always be genuine &amp; honest, but kind. “Majo” is our way of saying: be a good human. Be approachable, helpful, and warm. We’re building something ambitious, and it’s easier (and more fun) when we enjoy the ride together. We give feedback with kindness, challenge each other with respect, and celebrate wins together without ego.Urgency with FocusCreate the highest impact in the shortest amount of time. Move fast, but in the right direction. We operate with speed because time is our most limited resource. But speed without focus is chaos. We prioritize ruthlessly, act decisively, and stay aligned. We aim for high leverage: the biggest results from the simplest, smartest actions. We’re running a high-speed marathon — not a sprint with no strategy.Talent Density and MeritocracyHire only people who can raise the average; ‘exceptional performance is the passing grade.’ Ability trumps seniority. We believe the best teams are built on talent density — every hire should raise the bar. We reward contribution, not titles or tenure. We give ownership to those who earn it, and we all hold each other to a high standard. A-players want to work with other A-players — that’s how we win.First-Principles ThinkingStrip a problem to physics-level facts, ignore industry dogma, rebuild the solution from scratch. We don’t copy-paste solutions. We go back to basics, ask why things are the way they are, and rebuild from the ground up if needed. This mindset pushes us to innovate, challenge stale assumptions, and move faster than incumbents. It’s how we build what others think is impossible.The personal data provided in your application and during the selection process will be processed by Happyrobot, Inc., acting as Data Controller.By sending us your CV, you consent to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of evaluating and selecting you as a candidate for the position.

A country that has it all. The beaches. The mountains. The medieval châteaux. The fragrant cheese. The boulevards filled with flâneurs on bicycles and buses and trams, fresh baguettes popping out of their tote bags, pétanque balls ready to be deployed at a moment’s notice.France is also paradise on earth for public transportation nerds — no surprise, considering it’s where they invented the bus. Which is where you come in! As the first member of our service delivery team focused entirely on France, you’ll acquaint yourself with the local mobility terroir, memorize the infinite acronyms (AOT! AOM! IDFM! RATP! SNCF!) down to the letter, develop relationships with our growing stable of potes (like Keolis, Linead, Azalys, Pays de la Loire, SITAC, and others) and establish Transit as the premier cru of partners for all things “mobilité” in France.By making those partners stronger, whether by unlocking better transit ETAs for their riders, tracking diversions big and small with automatic detour detection, by improving rider satisfaction scores via rider surveys, or enriching partner’s web trip planners, apps, and internal tools with our suite of APIs, we’ve become the trusted associate of 180+ transport companies across the world, and the trusted app of millions of daily riders. Hoo-ha!Now, with you in the booth, we can help our French partners get even more out of their relationship with Transit. You’ll be on the phones, on the emails, and on the TGVs, building close relationships with operators and AOM partners, and championing their voice within the company. You’ll make sure no question, concern, or suggestion is left unanswered — in a single week, you’ll chase down answers to API issues, GTFS data bugs, operational snags (e.g., when a system is snagged by a strike or disruption), and be the trusted ambassador for Transit in the Hexagon.Sound like a plan? Merveilleux! Here’s what we need on your end…📝 ResponsibilitiesYou’ll help get new French partners on the train, and keep it moving.

You will be playing a pivotal role in making Paradox play at that level and becoming an iconic brand.\n\nFor us, being Iconic is to innovate at the intersection of Psychology x Creativity x Technology.\n\nYou’ll be at the heart of Paradox’s growth engine, working hand-in-hand with the CEO to build and scale the systems, team, and operations that power our global ambitions.\n\nTo do so, here are your 5 main responsibilities :\n\n1 | Lead Strategic Projects & CEO Initiatives\n\nFrom growth hacks to operational buildouts, you’ll own entire strategic projects.\n\nThink:\n\nBuilding a cold outreach engine or international brand partnerships\n\nSetting up sponsorships for our YouTube & events\n\nTesting acquisition channels & AI-powered growth playbooks\n\nSourcing elite talent & streamlining HR processes\n\nHelping secure and negotiate deals\n\n2 | Pirate Squad Rapid Experiments & Global Launches\n\nWe move fast, but we want to move even faster.

This is not for everyone. We’re looking for someone elite—both in mindset and execution. If this sounds like you, read on:\n\nYou likely come from a top-tier business or engineering school (HEC, ESSEC, X, Sciences Po, Stanford… you get the idea).\n\nYou’ve already built or scaled something—startup, ops team, or growth engine.\n\nYou’re driven with a strong work ethic – you show up with commitment, perseverance, and thrive under pressure.\n\nYou have a true entrepreneurial spirit – you can own projects from scratch, work with limited resources, and get your hands dirty to make things happen.\n\nYou execute relentlessly – a pragmatic problem-solver who thrives on ownership, not hand-holding.\n\nYou’re obsessed with growth – both personal and team-wide – and love learning, building, and optimizing.\n\nYou embrace growth over ego – open to feedback, eager to improve, and driven by progress, not praise.\n\nYou’re analytical, autonomous, and fast, with a natural ability to structure systems and automate for scale.\n\nYou’re tech-savvy and either already AI-native or actively becoming one—AI is your playground.\n\nYou’re naturally persuasive – you love influence, sales, negotiation, and can align others without force.\n\nYou excel in communication, both written and verbal, and tailor your message to your audience.\n\nYou’ll be working directly with a CEO who has extreme work ethic, expects excellence, and gives massive ownership. If that energizes rather than intimidates you, you’re in the right place.\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish: fluent. You can hold a conversation on specific details with English-speaking colleagues. Our chosen language for written communication is English.\n\nFrench: ideally bilingual.\n\nCurrently, 20% of the team is International, from the cherry blossoms of Japan, the Canadian lakes and to the forest of Madagascar.\n\nIT MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU\n-\n\nLet’s be clear, we are looking for someone who is not just Great, and for whom Paradox ambition isn’t just another cool project; but a true mission.\n\nSo if those personal interests : personal development / coaching / professional growth / education / edtech / teaching / edutainment are not things you REALLY love, let’s forget it!\n\nLet’s forget about it also if,\n\nYou don’t like to be challenged and grow in your job\n\nYou don't like receiving or giving tough feedbacks\n\nYou don’t question the status quo: the process are there for a reason, we have always done it this way\n\nYou like to have very specific & fixed tasks assigned to you.

What began as a mission to help restaurants better understand and serve their guests evolved into a powerful platform used by merchants around the world.\n\nWith best-in-class tools for marketing, operations, and guest experience — all deeply integrated with its industry-leading CRM — SevenRooms empowers operators to drive revenue, streamline operations, and deliver experiences that keep guests coming back.\n\nIn 2025, DoorDash acquired SevenRooms to strengthen its in-store strategy and expand its merchant-first offerings. The combination brings together DoorDash's scale, reach, and digital innovation with SevenRooms' in-store capabilities to support hospitality businesses across every channel — from discovery and delivery to on-premise dining.\n\nAs DoorDash builds out its in-store capabilities, SevenRooms plays a central role in enabling merchants to grow their businesses and connect more meaningfully with guests, whether they're ordering online or dining in. This move reflects DoorDash's broader commitment to empowering local businesses, fostering stronger connections between consumers and the places they love, and building technology that meets merchants — and their customers — wherever they are."}
