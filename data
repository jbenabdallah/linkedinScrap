The consequences include lost opportunities, exhausted personnel, and technology infrastructures unable to match the pace of contemporary business.IgniteTech is dismantling that framework. We substitute manual workflows with AI-native, self-optimizing systems operating at 10x the scale and velocity.

We don't stop at prototypes; we deliver production tools that immediately redefine operational execution.This position is not designed for candidates seeking to refine Jira workflows within a DevOps treadmill.
