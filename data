Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.\n\nWork at Veeva.

Our diverse team hails from 42 nationalities, with backgrounds ranging from self-taught DeFi natives to PhDs. Predominantly remote, we have hubs in London, Brussels, and Singapore, and host regular online and offline hangouts to keep the crew tight.\n\nWe are trading on more than 80 exchanges, and working with a wide array of asset issuers. As a well-established market maker, our distinctive expertise led us to expand rapidly. Today, our services span market making, options trading, high-frequency trading, OTC, and DeFi trading desks.\n\nBut we’re more than a service provider. We’re an initiator. We're pioneers in adopting the Rust Development language for our algorithmic trading, and champions of its use in the industry. We support the growth of Web3 startups through our Accelerator Program. We upgrade ecosystems by injecting liquidity into promising DeFi, RWA, and NFT protocols. And we push the industry's progress with our research and governance initiatives.\n\nAt Keyrock, we're not just envisioning the future of digital assets. We're actively building it.\n\nMission statement\n\nWe’re looking for a Product Manager to discover value, and design & define trading products, and also drive the ongoing development of existing trading systems. These trading systems are central to Keyrock DeFi operations, and used by internal research and quantitative trading teams.

Outcomes include systems that facilitate alpha discovery, capture and preservation by supporting the research and application of novel models, best-in-class on-chain execution and robust risk mitigation, including those specific to DeFi.\n\nIntelligence Augmentation: Ship automation features and tools that demonstrably reduce the cognitive load on human operators and manual intervention. This is measured by automating complex workflows like cross-chain and multi-strategy portfolio rebalancing, facilitating risk and trading configuration management on- and off-chain and automating monitoring and alerting in the context of DeFi operations.\n\nPerformance & Impact Measurement: Define key metrics and KPIs to measure the success and impact of DeFi-centric products, iterating based on data and feedback. Be able to identify why one piece of work is prioritised over another through (simple) models of impact.\n\nStrategic Alignment\n\nDeFi-Native Roadmap: Under the oversight of the Head of Product, develop and champion a product roadmap that explicitly links every DeFi initiative to core business OKRs. Continuously adapt the plan based on product outcomes updates, technical feasibility, and delivery timelines.\n\nGovernance: Establish and implement agile processes for product and feature validation, and data governance, ensuring all deployed systems are robust, secure, and compliant with both internal risk frameworks and evolving regulations like MiCA.\n\nLeading Continuous Delivery\n\nElite Delivery Performance: Drive the engineering team to achieve and maintain top-quartile delivery performance, measured by DORA metrics. This will be accomplished by driving a world-class DevOps culture, under the oversight of the Head of Product and Head of Engineering, that accelerates the safe, continuous deployment of trading algorithms.\n\nReduced On-Chain Execution Risk: Be accountable for minimising production incidents by delivering systems, processes, and optionally, AI tools, for automated smart contract analysis, pre-deployment strategy simulation, and real-time anomaly detection that safeguards our on-chain trading systems.\n\nEssentials\n\nRelevant Experience: Minimum of 3 years of experience working on technology-powered products in a product, design, engineering, Web3, or DeFi capacity.\n\nExperienced Product Leader: Solid understanding of product discovery, product delivery, and the business viability considerations of DeFi financial operations, including risk, regulatory alignment, and operational costs.\n\nTechnical Literacy: Ability to contribute meaningfully to technical discussions, with a working knowledge of cloud architecture, network constraints, and blockchain-integrated trading systems.\n\nProven Collaborator: Strong cross-functional collaboration skills with experience working alongside engineers, designers, and company leaders in fast-paced, distributed teams, towards shared goals.\n\nStrong communicator: Able to apply emotional intelligence and critical thinking, when dealing with cross-functional teams and stakeholders. Able to communicate and negotiate around team priorities.\n\nData driven: Working knowledge of product and delivery metrics (such as DORA) to guide iterative improvements, and business oriented metrics that measure impact.\n\nBeneficial experience\n\nExposure to quantitative/statistical analysis of DeFi assets and primitives (AMMs, CLAMMs, vAMMs, money markets, etc) and/or understanding of algorithmic trading.\n\nAny Agile or related qualification around iterative software development and/or product management.\n\nBackground in high-performance, regulated environments such as finance, crypto, DeFi, or algorithmic trading is a strong plus.\n\nBusiness strategy/marketing qualifications, or equivalent experience.\n\nOur recruitment philosophy\n\nWe value self-awareness in our recruitment process.

In parallel, most crypto tokenomics have failed to deliver long-term fairness, favoring insiders over users.\n\nWe're here to change that.\n\nUsual is the first stablecoin protocol that gives back ownership and value to its users. By turning users into stakeholders, we're building a more equitable financial infrastructure — one where value flows back to the community.\n\nIn just a few months, we built and launched a full protocol from scratch, introduced a new kind of stablecoin backed by tokenized US Treasuries (USD0), its yield-bearing counterpart (USD0++), and a revenue-sharing governance token ($USUAL). The protocol reached $1.8B in TVL at its peak and continues to evolve with major product and governance upgrades.\n\nWe're a small, focused team of DeFi natives with a strong execution track record and a clear ambition to reshape how value circulates in crypto.\n\n Your Role\n\nWe're looking for a Product Designer to take full ownership of design and user experience for a new product stack being developed inside Usual Lab.\n\nThis is a foundational role: you'll be the design lead within a small, autonomous squad — bridging design and development to ensure the products you design are implemented seamlessly and deliver the intended user experience.\n\nYour mission will be to translate complex mechanisms into intuitive user journeys, build the design system from scratch, and work hand-in-hand with engineers to bring your work into production.\n\nYou'll own the entire product design scope — and also play an active role in grooming, ticketing, syncing with devs, and following up on design implementation to ensure quality and alignment.\n\nThis role is perfect for someone who thrives in early-stage, fast-paced environments and wants to build real DeFi products from 0 1.\n\n‍ You'll Work Within a Dedicated Squad\nStack/Project Lead\nProduct Designer (you)\nTech Lead (Solidity)\n1 Solidity Engineer\n1 Backend Engineer\n1 Frontend Engineer\n1 Quant\n\n You will\nDesign elegant, user-centered experiences for a new DeFi product, from onboarding to edge cases.\nOwn and build a clean, scalable design system that sets the tone for this stack.\nCraft flows, interfaces, and prototypes that make complex interactions feel intuitive.\nWork closely with developers during grooming and implementation to ensure designs are understood, built to spec, and optimized in production.\nLead user journey mapping, interface structure, and micro-interactions.\nBuild high-fidelity prototypes and iterate quickly based on feedback.\nMaintain close collaboration with the product lead and engineers to ensure smooth delivery from design to deployment.\nContribute to brand and interface design for related web pages or dashboards.\n\n You Have\n4+ years in product or UX/UI design, ideally with experience in fintech or DeFi.\nExperience designing for Web3 platforms (wallets, tokens, flows, DeFi user behaviors).\nStrong design craft: attention to layout, micro-interactions, responsiveness, accessibility.\nFluency with Figma — including auto-layout, components, and prototyping.\nAbility to explain design decisions clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\nBonus: Experience with Framer or similar tools for building lightweight marketing pages.\nBonus: Experience collaborating directly with engineers on delivery and QA.\n\n You Are\nAutonomous and proactive — you take ownership and push things forward.\nCurious and comfortable working with technical teams.\nA strong communicator who builds trust across design and engineering.\nNot afraid to start from a blank page and make decisions in ambiguous contexts.\nPassionate about DeFi, crypto, and building for real users.\n\n What Success Looks Like\nA thoughtful, consistent user experience that makes complex DeFi mechanisms feel effortless.\nA design system that's scalable and easy for devs to implement.\nSmooth, collaborative workflows between design and engineering — ensuring what's in production matches what's been designed.\nClear product flows, fast iteration, and tight handoff between design and engineering.\nYou're the go-to person for product design decisions — and a key contributor to delivery quality.\n\n Why Join Us?\nWork in a small, elite team at the frontier of DeFi.\nTake full ownership of a product experience from day one.\nShape a new product stack with autonomy and velocity.\nShip real products with impact — no red tape, no middle layers.\nCompetitive salary and token options.\nRemote-first, async-friendly culture."}

Today, Material UI stands as one of the most popular open-source libraries on GitHub and has paved the way for the fully-fledged startup known as MUI (founded in 2019), which now boasts an ever-expanding ecosystem of React UI products.We're a company of 35+ people as of early 2024, and we're growing.The productsMUI is best known for our flagship product, Material UI—but this is just one of three core component libraries we maintain. Base UI is our headless component library, and Pigment CSS is a zero-runtime CSS-in-JS styling engine. We also host Design Kits and pre-built Templates.Beyond the core libraries, MUI X offers advanced components like the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, and Charts, for more complex user interactions and data visualization needs.We're also making ambitious moves to incorporate our full suite of components into Toolpad, a low-code admin builder tool for assembling full-stack apps faster than ever.Learn more about MUI's products in this blog post: An introduction to the MUI ecosystem.The cultureMUI is a fully remote company with a team that spans the globe.
